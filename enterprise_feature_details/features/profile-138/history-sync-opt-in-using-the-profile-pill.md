**Description**:
In Chrome 138, some signed-in users see a new option to opt in to history and tab sync. This change is designed to offer the benefits of history sync in a non-disruptive way by using the profile pill to display a short in-line message. Users who click on the profile pill are taken to their profile menu where they can choose to turn on sync. The goal is to provide users with an intuitive and contextually relevant entry point for syncing data like browsing history, separate from the sign-in flow. For Enterprise users, the expanded profile pill only appears after 4 hours of browser inactivity.
    Relevant enterprise policies controlling History or Tab sync ([SyncDisabled](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#SyncDisabled), [SyncTypesListDisabled](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#SyncTypesListDisabled) and [SavingBrowserHistoryDisabled](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#SavingBrowserHistoryDisabled)) continue to work as before.
