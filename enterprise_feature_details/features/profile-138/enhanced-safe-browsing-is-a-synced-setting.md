**Description**:
In Chrome 138, Chrome's Enhanced Safe Browsing is a synced feature. This means that if a user opts into Enhanced Safe Browsing on one device, this protection level automatically applies across all other devices where they are signed into Chrome with the same account. The goal is to provide stronger, more consistent security protection and a standardized user experience.
    Users who enable Enhanced Safe Browsing benefit from its protections, for example, proactive phishing protection, improved detection of malware and malicious extensions consistently across their synced Chrome instances on Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux, ChromeOS), Android, and iOS. Users receive onscreen notifications when their Enhanced Safe Browsing setting is synced.
    The Safe Browsing protection level is an existing feature, controlled by the [SafeBrowsingProtectionLevel](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#SafeBrowsingProtectionLevel) policy.
