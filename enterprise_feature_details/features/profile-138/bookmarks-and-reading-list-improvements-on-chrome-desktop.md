**Description**:
For Chrome 138 on Desktop, some users who sign in to Chrome upon saving a new bookmark can now use and save bookmarks and reading list items in their Google Account. Relevant enterprise policies controlling bookmarks, as well as [BrowserSignin](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#BrowserSignin), [SyncDisabled](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#SyncDisabled) or [SyncTypesListDisabled](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#SyncTypesListDisabled), continue to work as before, so admins can configure whether or not users can use and save items in their Google Account. Setting [EditBookmarksEnabled](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#EditBookmarksEnabled) to false also prevents users from uploading a bookmark saved on their device to their Google Account.
