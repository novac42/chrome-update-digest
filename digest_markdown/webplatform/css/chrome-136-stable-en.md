# Chrome 136 CSS Updates - Stable Release

## Area Summary

Chrome 136 brings significant CSS improvements focused on print styling, HDR content management, and enhanced security for visited link styling. The most impactful changes include the standardization of `print-color-adjust` (removing the webkit prefix), a new `dynamic-range-limit` property for HDR displays, and improved privacy through partitioned `:visited` link history. These updates strengthen CSS's capabilities for both print media and modern display technologies while maintaining backward compatibility. The release also includes refinements to CSS custom properties and attribute functions, demonstrating continued evolution of CSS's foundational features.

## Detailed Updates

These CSS updates in Chrome 136 span from new HDR display capabilities to important security improvements and standardization efforts.

### The dynamic-range-limit property

#### What's New
Introduces a new CSS property that allows web pages to limit the maximum brightness of HDR (High Dynamic Range) content, providing better control over content display on HDR-capable devices.

#### Technical Details
This property works with the CSS Color HDR specification to manage brightness levels dynamically. It enables developers to set constraints on how bright HDR content can appear, ensuring consistent viewing experiences across different display capabilities.

#### Use Cases
Particularly useful for media-rich applications, gaming websites, and content platforms where controlling HDR brightness is crucial for user experience. Helps prevent overly bright content that might be uncomfortable or problematic on certain displays.

### Partition :visited links history

#### What's New
Implements a significant security improvement that partitions the `:visited` pseudo-class behavior to prevent browsing history leaks across different sites and origins.

#### Technical Details
Anchor elements now only receive `:visited` styling if they have been clicked from the same top-level site and frame origin. The system includes an exception for "self-links" where sites can style links to their own pages as `:visited` even without prior clicks from that specific context.

#### Use Cases
This change is primarily a security enhancement that protects user privacy by preventing malicious sites from detecting which external sites a user has visited. Web developers should test their styling to ensure visited link appearance works as expected within the new partitioned model.

### Unprefixed print-color-adjust

#### What's New
The `print-color-adjust` property is now available without the `-webkit-` prefix, representing a move toward standardized CSS for print styling control.

#### Technical Details
This property controls color adjustments in printed web pages, functioning identically to the existing `-webkit-print-color-adjust` property. The webkit-prefixed version remains supported for backward compatibility, allowing for a smooth transition period.

#### Use Cases
Essential for websites that need to control how colors appear in print media, such as documents, reports, or any content designed for printing. Developers can now use the standard property name while maintaining compatibility with older implementations.

### Rename string attr() type to raw-string

#### What's New
Updates the CSS `attr()` function syntax to use `raw-string` instead of `string` as the type parameter, following CSS Working Group resolution.

#### Technical Details
The change updates the syntax from `attr(data-foo string)` to `attr(data-foo raw-string)`. This modification aligns with the latest CSS specifications and provides more precise terminology for the attribute value type handling.

#### Use Cases
Affects any CSS that uses the `attr()` function with string type specification. Developers using this feature should update their CSS to use the new `raw-string` syntax, though the functionality remains the same.

### Type-agnostic var() fallback

#### What's New
Modifies the `var()` function behavior so that fallback values are no longer validated against the type of the custom property being referenced.

#### Technical Details
This change makes the fallback mechanism more flexible by removing type checking between the custom property and its fallback value. The fallback can now be of any valid CSS type regardless of what the custom property was originally defined to accept.

#### Use Cases
Provides more flexibility when working with CSS custom properties, allowing for more robust fallback strategies. Particularly useful in component systems where fallback values might need to be of different types than the primary custom property values.
