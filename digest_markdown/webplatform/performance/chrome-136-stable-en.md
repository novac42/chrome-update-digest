# Performance Digest - Chrome 136 Stable

## Area Summary

Chrome 136 introduces a significant advancement in performance measurement capabilities for web applications through bimodal performance timing understanding. This update addresses a critical gap in performance monitoring by helping developers identify and analyze performance variations that occur due to external factors beyond their application's control. The feature enables more accurate performance assessment by distinguishing between different operational states, such as cold start scenarios versus warm application states. This enhancement represents an important step forward in providing developers with more nuanced performance insights, allowing for better optimization strategies and more realistic performance expectations.

## Detailed Updates

Building on the core theme of enhanced performance visibility, this release focuses on giving developers better tools to understand the complexities of real-world performance patterns.

### Enable web applications to understand bimodal performance timings

#### What's New
Web applications can now better understand and analyze bimodal distribution patterns in page load performance through enhanced timing APIs. This feature helps identify performance variations caused by external factors beyond the application's direct control.

#### Technical Details
The implementation leverages the Navigation Timing specification to provide more granular performance data that can distinguish between different system states. When a user agent performs a "cold start," expensive initialization tasks compete for system resources, creating measurably different performance characteristics compared to warm starts. The feature exposes these timing differences through enhanced APIs that can detect and report on these bimodal patterns.

#### Use Cases
Developers can use this capability to:
- Build more accurate performance monitoring dashboards that account for system state variations
- Implement adaptive loading strategies based on detected performance conditions
- Create more realistic performance budgets that consider cold start scenarios
- Improve user experience by adjusting application behavior based on detected performance patterns
