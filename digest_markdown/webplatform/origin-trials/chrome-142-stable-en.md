# Area Summary

Chrome 142 (stable) introduces an Origin Trial for Device Bound Session Credentials, a server-driven mechanism to bind web sessions to a single device. This origin trial focuses on stronger session security by enabling the browser to prove possession of a device-specific private key and periodically renew the session on the server's schedule. For developers, this enables per-device session guarantees that can reduce session theft and improve account security without requiring complex client-side cryptography management. The update advances the web platform by standardizing a server-friendly proof-of-possession flow that integrates with existing session architectures.

## Detailed Updates

The single origin-trial feature in this release delivers a focused security primitive for developers who need device-bound session semantics.

### Device Bound Session Credentials

#### What's New
A mechanism that lets servers securely bind a session to a single device. The browser renews the session periodically as requested by the server, providing proof of possession of a private key.

#### Technical Details
- Sessions are tied to a device-specific private key; the browser demonstrates possession when renewing the session.
- Renewal is server-driven and periodic, enabling servers to control session lifetimes while verifying device possession.
- This capability is available via an Origin Trial in Chrome 142 (medium importance).

#### Use Cases
- Enforcing per-device session tokens for higher assurance (e.g., sensitive account operations).
- Reducing risk from stolen session tokens by requiring device-bound proof-of-possession on renewal.
- Integrating with server-side session management to revoke or rotate device-bound credentials on schedule.
