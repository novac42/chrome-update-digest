## Isolated Web Apps (IWAs)

### Controlled Frame API (available only to IWAs)

This feature adds a Controlled Frame API available only to Isolated Web Apps (IWAs). Like similarly-named APIs on other platforms, Controlled Frame allows embedding all content, even third-party content that cannot be embedded in `<iframe>`. Controlled Frame also allows controlling embedded content with a collection of API methods and events. For more information about Isolated Web Apps, see the [Isolated Web Apps explainer](https://github.com/WICG/isolated-web-apps/blob/main/README.md).
