## Detailed Updates

Below are the detailed notes for the change summarized above and its implications for development workflows.

### Save and copy canvas images

#### What's New
Chrome users can now right-click on a WebGPU canvas and access context menu options "Save Image Asâ€¦" or "Copy Image."

#### Technical Details
This feature exposes Save/Copy image actions from the browser context menu for canvases backed by WebGPU rendering. The change is tracked in the Chromium issue referenced below.

#### Use Cases
- Quick capture of a WebGPU-rendered frame for debugging or visual regression checks.
- Convenience for designers and testers to export renders without adding page-level image export code.
- Simplifies sharing snapshots of GPU-generated visuals during development reviews.

Relevance to area-specific concerns:
- graphics-webgpu: Directly benefits workflows around GPU rendering by easing capture of canvas output.
- webapi: Improves the end-user experience for canvas elements using WebGPU without requiring API changes.
- performance & debugging: Low-effort capture aids performance analysis and visual debugging workflows.
- multimedia & developer tooling: Facilitates asset extraction for documentation and testing.
