## Origin trials

### Full frame rate render blocking attribute

Adds a new render blocking token `full-frame-rate` to the blocking attributes. When the renderer is blocked with the `full-frame-rate` token, the renderer will work at a lower frame rate so as to reserve more resources for loading.

### Pause media playback on not-rendered iframes

Adds a `media-playback-while-not-rendered` permission policy to allow embedder websites to pause media playback of embedded iframes which aren't renderedâ€”that is, have their display property set to `none`. This should allow developers to build more user-friendly experiences and to also improve the performance by letting the browser handle the playback of content that is not visible to users.

### Rewriter API

The Rewriter API transforms and rephrases input text in requested ways, backed by an on-device AI language model. Developers may use this API to remove redundancies within a text in order to fit into a word limit, rephrase messages to suit the intended audience or to be more constructive if a message is found to use toxic language, rephrasing a post or article to use simpler words and concepts and more.

### Writer API

The Writer API can be used for writing new material given a writing task prompt, backed by an on-device AI language model. Developers will be able to use this API to generate textual explanations of structured data, composing a post about a product based on reviews or product description, expanding on pro and con lists into full views and more.
