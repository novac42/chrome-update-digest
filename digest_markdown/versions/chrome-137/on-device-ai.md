### Rewriter API

The Rewriter API transforms and rephrases input text in requested ways, backed by an on-device AI language model. Developers may use this API to remove redundancies within a text in order to fit into a word limit, rephrase messages to suit the intended audience or to be more constructive if a message is found to use toxic language, rephrasing a post or article to use simpler words and concepts and more.
