# Chrome 139 - Security & Privacy

## Security

### Fire error event for Content Security Policy (CSP) blocked worker

Makes Chrome conform to the specification, checking the CSP during fetch and firing the error event asynchronously instead of throwing exception when script runs "new Worker(url)" or "new SharedWorker(url)".

[Tracking bug #41285169](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/41285169) | [ChromeStatus.com entry](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5177205656911872) | [Spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#fetch-integration)
