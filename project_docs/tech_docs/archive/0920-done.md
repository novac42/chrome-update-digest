- [ ] Confirm `chrome_update_digest` as the canonical package namespace and capture the modules queued for migration before any file moves (project_docs/tech_docs/uv-packaging-plan.md:14)
- [ ] Create the `src/chrome_update_digest/` directory with minimal `__init__.py` scaffolding so existing imports keep working during the reshuffle (project_docs/tech_docs/uv-packaging-plan.md:14)
- [ ] Relocate processors, utils, and tooling modules into the new package in manageable batches, smoke-testing `python -m chrome_update_digest.processors.clean_data_pipeline ...` after each batch (project_docs/tech_docs/uv-packaging-plan.md:15)
- [ ] Normalize remaining imports to `chrome_update_digest.*` and eliminate any `sys.path.insert` or similar hacks in code and tests (project_docs/tech_docs/uv-packaging-plan.md:16)
- [ ] Run the module-based pipeline command plus the full test suite to validate the Phase 1 import graph and log any regressions for follow-up (project_docs/tech_docs/uv-packaging-plan.md:17)
- [ ] Implement `src/utils/project_paths.py` exposing `PROJECT_ROOT` and helpers for `upstream_docs` and other shared directories (project_docs/tech_docs/upstream_docs_path_fix_plan.md:10)
- [ ] Update `CleanDataPipeline`, `YAMLPipeline`, `generate_github_pages_navigation`, and similar scripts to rely on the shared helper while keeping configurable overrides (project_docs/tech_docs/upstream_docs_path_fix_plan.md:11)
- [ ] Ensure parameters like `base_path` default to `PROJECT_ROOT`, enabling tests to inject temporary paths without extra plumbing (project_docs/tech_docs/upstream_docs_path_fix_plan.md:12)
- [ ] Run unit tests and execute the pipelines from the repository root to confirm outputs are now written to `PROJECT_ROOT/upstream_docs/...` (project_docs/tech_docs/upstream_docs_path_fix_plan.md:14)
- [ ] Re-run the pipelines from within `src/` to verify the working-directory sensitivity is resolved and outputs still land at the repository root (project_docs/tech_docs/upstream_docs_path_fix_plan.md:7)
