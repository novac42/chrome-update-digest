- title: 'Align error type thrown for payment WebAuthn credential creation: SecurityError becomes NotAllowedError'
  content: 'Correct the error type thrown during WebAuthn credential creation for payment credentials. Due to a historic specification
    mismatch, creating a payment credential in a cross-origin iframe without a user activation would throw a `SecurityError`
    instead of a `NotAllowedError`, which is what is thrown for non-payment credentials. This is a breaking change, albeit
    a niche one. Code that previously detected the type of error thrown (for example, `e instanceof SecurityError`) is affected.
    Code that just generally handles errors during credential creation (for example, `catch (e)`) will continue to function
    correctly.
