- title: JavaScript promise integration
  content: 'JavaScript Promise Integration (JSPI) is an API that allows WebAssembly applications to integrate with JavaScript
    Promises. It allows a WebAssembly program to act as the generator of a Promise, and it allows the WebAssembly program
    to interact with Promise-bearing APIs. In particular, when an application uses JSPI to call a Promise-bearing (JavaScript)
    API, the WebAssembly code is suspended; and the original caller to the WebAssembly program is given a Promise that will
    be fulfilled when the WebAssembly program finally completes.

- title: Branch Hints
  content: 'Improves the performance of compiled WebAssembly code by informing the engine that a particular branch instruction
    is very likely to take a specific path. This allows the engine to make better decisions for code layout (improving instruction
    cache hits) and register allocation.
