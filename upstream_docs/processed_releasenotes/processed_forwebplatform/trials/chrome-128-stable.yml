- title: Digital Credentials API
  content: 'Websites can request credentials from mobile wallet apps through a variety of mechanisms today, for example custom
    URL handlers and QR code scanning. This feature lets sites request identity information from digital credentials inside
    wallets using Android''s IdentityCredential CredMan system. It''s extensible to support multiple credential formats (for
    example, ISO mDoc and W3C verifiable credential) and allows multiple wallet apps to be used. The API also includes mechanisms
    to reduce the risk of ecosystem-scale abuse of sensitive identity information.

- title: FedCM multiple identity providers in single `get()` call
  content: 'Allows FedCM to show multiple identity providers in the same dialog. This gives developers a convenient way to
    present all supported identity providers to users. We are planning to first tackle the case of having all providers in
    the same `get()` call.

- title: Disable standardized CSS zoom
  content: 'The implementation of the previously non-standard CSS `zoom` property has been updated to align with the new standard.
    This changes various JavaScript APIs to align with the specification, changes `zoom` to apply to iframe content documents,
    and changes it to apply to all inherited length properties where previously it only changed the inherited `font-size`.


    This trial lets you opt back into the previous behavior to have more time to adjust your code.
