- title: FedCM as a trust signal for the Storage Access API
  content: 'Reconciles the FedCM and Storage Access APIs by making a prior FedCM grant a valid reason to automatically approve
    a storage access request.


    When a user grants permission for using their identity with a third-party Identity Provider (IdP) on a Relying Party (RP),
    many IdPs require third-party cookies to function correctly and securely. This proposal aims to satisfy that requirement
    in a private and secure manner by updating the Storage Access API (SAA) permission checks to not only accept the permission
    grant that is given by a storage access prompt, but also the permission grant that is given by a FedCM prompt.


    A key property of this mechanism is limiting the grant to cases explicitly allowed by the RP through the FedCM permissions
    policy, enforcing a per-frame control for the RP and preventing passive surveillance by the IdP beyond the capabilities
    that FedCM already grants.

  content: 'This reverse origin trial excludes sites from the launch of Media Previews.


    Chrome will provide real-time previews of camera and microphone input at the time camera and microphone permissions are
    requested by websites. These will also be available from the site''s pageinfo.


    In addition, users with multiple devices will be able to select a camera and microphone at the time permissions are requested,
    unless the site has requested a specific device through `getUserMedia()`.

  content: 'Developers can start taking part in an origin trial for a bundle of desktop FedCM features that can include authorization.
    The bundle consists of FedCM Continuation API, Parameter API, Fields API, Multiple configURLs, and Custom Account Labels.
    This enables an OAuth authorization flow-like experience involving an IdP-provided permission dialog.

  content: 'Provide a new HTML element that interacts with the permission flow.


    The permission prompt is currently triggered directly from JavaScript without the user agent having any strong signal
    of the user''s intent. Having an in-content element that the user uses to trigger the permission flow allows for improved
    permission prompt UX for users as well as a recovery path from the "denied" permission state for sites.
