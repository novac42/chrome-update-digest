- title: Pause media playback on not-rendered iframes
  content: 'Adds a `media-playback-while-not-rendered` permission policy to allow embedder websites to pause media playback
    of embedded iframes which aren''t renderedâ€”that is, have their display property set to `none`. This should allow developers
    to build more user-friendly experiences and to also improve the performance by letting the browser handle the playback
    of content that is not visible to users.
