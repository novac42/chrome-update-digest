- title: Prompt API
  content: 'An API designed for interacting with an AI language model using text, image, and audio inputs. It supports various
    use cases, from generating image captions and performing visual searches to transcribing audio, classifying sound events,
    generating text following specific instructions, and extracting information or insights from text. It supports structured
    outputs which ensure that responses adhere to a predefined format, typically expressed as a JSON schema, to enhance response
    conformance and facilitate seamless integration with downstream applications that require standardized output formats.


    This API is also exposed in Chrome Extensions. This feature entry tracks the exposure on the web. An enterprise policy
    (`GenAILocalFoundationalModelSettings`) is available to disable the underlying model downloading which would render this
    API unavailable.

- title: Extended lifetime shared workers
  content: 'This adds a new option, `extendedLifetime: true`, to the `SharedWorker` constructor. This requests that the shared
    worker be kept alive even after all current clients have unloaded. The primary use case is to allow pages to perform asynchronous
    work that requires JavaScript after a page unloads, without needing to rely on a service worker.

  content: 'A mediation mode for `navigator.credentials.get()` that causes browser sign-in UI to be displayed to the user
    if there is a passkey or password for the site that is immediately known to the browser. Otherwise, it rejects the with
    `NotAllowedError` if there is no such credential available. This allows the site to avoid showing a sign-in page if the
    browser can offer a choice of sign-in credentials that are likely to succeed, while still allowing a sign-in page flow
    for cases where there are no such credentials.

    and Direct3D11. By opting into this mode and obeying its constraints, developers can extend the reach of their WebGPU
    applications to many older devices that don''t have the modern, explicit graphics APIs that core WebGPU requires.
