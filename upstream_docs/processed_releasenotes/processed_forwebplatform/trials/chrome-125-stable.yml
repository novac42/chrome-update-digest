- title: FedCM Button Mode API and Use Other Account API
  content: 'This origin trial includes the following two FedCM APIs.


    The Button Mode API lets websites call FedCM inside a button click, such as clicking on a **Sign-in to IdP** button. This
    requires FedCM to guarantee it always responds with a visible user interface, as opposed to widget mode, which doesn''t
    show a UI when users log out. Calling the FedCM API in _button mode_ takes users to login to the IdP (in a dialog window),
    when users are logged-out.


    Also, because the button mode is called within an explicit user gesture, the UI may also be more prominent (for example,
    centered and modal) compared to the UI from the widget mode (which doesn''t have such explicit intention). Learn more
    about how the Button Mode API works in [FedCM updates: Button Mode API origin trial, CORS and SameSite](https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/blog/fedcm-chrome-125-updates#button-mode-api)


    The Use Other Account API lets an Identity Provider allow users to sign in to other accounts.

- title: Skip preload scanning
  content: 'Skips the [preload scanner](https://web.dev/articles/preload-scanner) to explore performance tradeoffs for pages
    with no sub-resource fetches.


    The preload scanner step benefits performance of pages with sub-resource fetches, through implementation of the speculative
    prefetch. However, for pages that don''t benefit from this step, that is, for pages with no sub-resources, this is additional
    processing overhead with little benefit.


    For advanced web users who would like to benefit by reducing this overhead, this experiment provides a page-level control
    to disable the preload scanner. Data collected from this experiment could evaluate if a modified API or a different implementation
    of the HTML preload scanner would be helpful.
