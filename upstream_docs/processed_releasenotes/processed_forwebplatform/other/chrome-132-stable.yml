- title: 'Fetch: `Request.bytes()` and `Response.bytes()`'
  content: "Add a `bytes()` method to the `Request` and `Response` interfaces, which returns a promise that resolves with\
    \ a Uint8Array. While `Request` and `Response` have an `arrayBuffer()` method, you can't read directly from a buffer.\
    \ You have to create a view such as a `Uint8Array` to read it. The `bytes()` method improves the ergonomics of getting\
    \ the body of Request and Response.\n\n**Baseline Newly Available:** This feature is now available in all three major\
    \ browser engines. \n\n[Tracking bug #340206277](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/340206277) | [ChromeStatus.com entry](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5239268180754432)\

- title: Capture all screens
  content: 'Capture all the screens connected to the device using `getAllScreensMedia()`.


    Calling `getDisplayMedia()` multiple times requires multiple user gestures, burdens the user with choosing the next screen
    each time, and does not guarantee to the app that all the screens were selected. The `getAllScreensMedia()` method improves
    on all of these fronts.


    **Note:** As this feature has privacy ramifications, it is only exposed behind the `MultiScreenCaptureAllowedForUrls`
    enterprise policy, and users are warned before recording even starts, that recording _could_ start at some point. The
    API will only work for origins that are specified in the `MultiScreenCaptureAllowedForUrls` allowlist. Any origin not
    specified there, won''t have access to it.


    This feature is shipping on Desktop only.

- title: Element Capture
  content: 'Given a video `MediaStreamTrack` obtained through pre-existing means to initiate tab-capture, [Element Capture](/docs/web-platform/element-capture)
    allows mutating the track to only capture a subtree of the DOM starting at a given Element.


    The API bears some resemblance to the Region Capture API, but affords greater flexibility for applications, because occluding
    and occluded content are both excluded from the capture.
