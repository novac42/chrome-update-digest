- title: Deprecate asynchronous range removal for Media Source Extensions
  content: 'The Media Source standard long ago changed to disallow ambiguously defined behavior involving asynchronous range
    removals: `SourceBuffer.abort()` no longer aborts `SourceBuffer.remove()` operations. Setting `MediaSource.duration` can
    no longer truncate currently buffered media. Exceptions will be thrown in both of these cases now. Safari and Firefox
    have long shipped this behavior, Chromium is the last browser remaining with the old behavior. Use counters show that
    around 0.001%-0.005% of page loads hit the deprecated behavior. If a site hits this issue, playback may now break. Usage
    of `abort()` cancelling removals is increasing, so it''s prudent to resolve this deprecation before more incompatible
    usage appears.
