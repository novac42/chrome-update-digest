- title: The `securePaymentConfirmationAvailability` API
  content: 'This is a JavaScript API to provide an easier way to check if the Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC) feature is
    available. With this API, the only way to determine SPC''s availability was to create a `PaymentRequest` with the required
    parameters, which is clunky and difficult in the case where a developer wants to check for SPC before starting to process
    a payment.

    Websites can query the availability of on-device speech recognition for specific languages, prompt users to install the
    necessary resources for on-device speech recognition, and choose between on-device or cloud-based speech recognition as
    needed.

- title: Randomize TCP port allocation on Windows
  content: 'This launch enables TCP port randomization on versions of Windows (2020 or later) where we don''t expect to see
    issues with re-use of prior ports occurring too fast (causing rejection due to timeouts on port re-use). The rapid port
    re-use issue arises from the Birthday problem, where the probability of randomly re-picking a port already seen rapidly
    converges with 100% for each new port chosen when compared to port re-use in a sequential model.
