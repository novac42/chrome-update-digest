- title: '`PointerEvent.deviceProperties` for multi-pen inking'
  content: 'Currently, developers have no way to distinguish between two individual pens on an ink-enabled digitizer. The
    existing `PointerEvent.id` attribute is implemented in different ways and does not always persist for each ink stroke
    or interaction with the screen.


    This change provides a secure and reliable way to identify individual pen (pointers) interacting with the screen to set
    specific colors or pen shapes for each device interacting with the digitizer. It extends the `PointerEvent` interface
    to include a new attribute, `deviceProperties`. This contains the attribute `uniqueId`, that represents a session-persistent,
    document isolated, unique identifier that a developer can reliably use to identify individual pens interacting with the
    page.

  content: 'Chrome 128 adds a cross-site ancestor bit to the key ring of the partitioned cookie''s `CookiePartitionKey`. This
    change unifies the partition key with the partition key values used in storage partitioning and adds protection against
    clickjacking attacks by preventing cross-site embedded frames from having access to the top-level-site''s partitioned
    cookies.

  content: 'Modifies the [Private Aggregation API](https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/relevance/private-aggregation)
    to merge histogram contributions with the same bucket and filtering ID before embedding in the aggregatable report''s
    encrypted payload.


    Private Aggregation imposes a limit on the number of contributions that can be embedded in a single aggregatable report,
    with any additional contributions being dropped. By merging contributions where possible, we can get additional utility
    out of the limit. Note that, ignoring the dropping of excess contributions, merging these sorts of contributions shouldn''t
    have any impact on the final summary reports.
