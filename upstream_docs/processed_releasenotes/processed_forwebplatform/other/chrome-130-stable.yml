- title: Attribution Reporting API feature (Attribution Scopes)
  content: 'This change is based on ad tech feedback and the need for more fine grained filtering controls before the attribution
    process takes place. It lets API callers specify a field called "attribution scopes" which will be used for filtering
    before starting the regular attribution flow. This allows API callers more fine grained control over the attribution granularity
    and the ability to receive proper attribution reports when there are multiple different advertisers or campaigns that
    all convert on the same destination site.

- title: Attribution Reporting API feature (debug key privacy improvement)
  content: 'This change helps to mitigate a potential privacy gap with debug keys.


    Currently the API allows a source debug key or a trigger debug key to be specified if third-party cookies are available
    and can be set by API callers. If either a source or trigger debug key is specified then it will be included in the attribution
    report. This may lead to a privacy leak if third-party cookies are only allowed on either the publisher or the advertiser
    site but not both.


    This change mitigates this issue by enforcing that source debug keys and trigger debug keys are only included in the attribution
    report if they''re present on both the source and trigger, which would mean that third-party cookies were available on
    both the publisher and advertiser site. This change will apply to both event-level reports and aggregatable reports.
