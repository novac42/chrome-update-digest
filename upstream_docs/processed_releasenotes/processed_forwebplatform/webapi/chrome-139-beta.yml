- title: 'Web App Manifest: specify update eligibility, icon URLs are `Cache-Control: immutable`'
  content: Specify an update eligibility algorithm in the manifest spec. This makes the update process more deterministic
    and predictable, giving developers more control over whether (and when) updates should apply to existing installations,
    and allowing removal of the 'update check throttle' that user agents currently need to implement to avoid wasting network
    resources.

  content: 'Exposes several new mechanisms to customize the behavior of the depth sensing feature within a WebXR session,
    with the goal of improving the performance of the generation or consumption of the depth buffer. The key mechanisms exposed
    are: the ability to request the raw or smooth depth buffer, the ability to request that the runtime stop or resume providing
    the depth buffer, and the ability to expose a depth buffer that does not align with the user''s view exactly, so that
    the user agent does not need to perform unnecessary re-projections every frame.'

- title: Allow more characters in JavaScript DOM APIs
  content: The HTML parser has always (or for a long time) allowed elements and attributes to have a wide variety of valid
    characters and names, but the JavaScript DOM APIs that create the same elements and attributes are more strict and don't
    match the parser. This change relaxes the validation of the JavaScript DOM APIs to match the HTML parser.

- title: '`request-close` invoker command'
  content: Dialog elements can be closed through a variety of mechanisms, sometimes developers want to have the ability to
    prevent closure. To achieve this dialogs fire a cancel event. Originally this was only fired via a close request (for
    example, `Esc` key press), recently a `requestClose()` JS function was added which also fires the cancel event. The `request-close`
    command brings that new ability to the declarative invoker commands API.

  content: 'Currently, the scroll anchoring algorithm selects priority candidates when they are available as anchor targets.
    The priority candidates are currently a focused editable element and find-in-page highlights. This can cause suboptimal
    user experience if there is a large focused contenteditable element that has content changed offscreen (the cursor ends
    up being shifted as a consequence). This fix changes the algorithm: instead of selecting the priority candidate as the
    anchor, use the candidate as the scope or root of the regular anchor selection algorithm that selects the deepest onscreen
    element as the anchor.'

    that switches browsing context groups, which can leak information and potentially be used as a tracking vector. Clearing
    the `window.name` property addresses this issue. This should be a low risk change since looking up a browsing context
    by name already doesn’t work if it''s in another browsing context group, so the name isn''t actually useful.

  content: Chromium now recognizes all valid JSON MIME types as defined by the WHATWG mimesniff specification. This includes
    any MIME type whose subtype ends with `+json`, in addition to the traditional `application/json` and `text/json`. This
    change ensures that web APIs and features relying on JSON detection behave consistently with the web platform standard
    and other browsers. A key motivation for this change is to fix JSON module import behavior, where previously valid JSON
    MIME types like `text/html+json` and `image/svg+json` would fail to load as modules.

- title: 'Private Aggregation API: aggregate error reporting'
  content: There are a range of error conditions that can be hit when using the Private Aggregation API. For example, the
    privacy budget could run out, preventing any further histogram contributions. This feature allows developers to register
    histogram contributions that should only be sent if a particular type of error occurs. This feature supports measuring
    the frequency of the error conditions and to split these measurements on relevant developer-specified dimensions (e.g.
    version of deployed code). As the errors themselves may be cross-site information, we cannot simply expose them to the
    page for users without third-party cookies. Instead, this feature reuses the existing aggregate, noised reporting pipelines
    through the Aggregation Service.

    reports. Developers can supply a separate URL to the well-known endpoint named `crash-reporting`, to direct crash reports
    there, instead of the `default` endpoint.

    We now send the user’s most preferred language in the `Accept-Language` header. To minimize compatibility risks, the initial
    launch reduces the information in the HTTP header, we’ll reduce the related `navigator.languages` JavaScript getters in
    the future.
