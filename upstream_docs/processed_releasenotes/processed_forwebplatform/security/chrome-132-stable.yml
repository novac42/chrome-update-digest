- title: Ignore `Strict-Transport-Security` for localhost
  content: '`Strict-Transport-Security` (STS) response headers can cause problems for localhost web servers because STS applies
    host-wide, across all ports. This causes compatibility problems for web developers testing locally. It also affects end-users
    who use software packages that commonly start localhost web servers for ephemeral reasons. For example, communication
    of an auth token from a web login to a local software package. If one local listener sets `Strict-Transport-Security`
    on a localhost response, it''s applied to all subsequent localhost requests regardless of port.


    Chrome 132 resolves this problem by ignoring `Strict-Transport-Security` headers on responses from localhost URLs.
