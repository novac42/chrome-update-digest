- title: Language support for CanvasTextDrawingStyles
  content: 'The `<canvas>` DOM element, like all DOM elements, accepts a `lang` attribute that is used to define language
    specific treatment for font selection (when fonts have locale specific glyphs). Browsers respect this attribute. However,
    when an `OffscreenCanvas` is created there is no way to set locale information, possibly resulting in a state where an
    offscreen canvas produces rendered results that differ from the canvas in which its output is used. This feature adds
    a `lang` IDL attribute to `CanvasTextDrawingStyles` to give developers direct control over the language for the text drawing
    and metrics.
