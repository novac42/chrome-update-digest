- title: The `writingsuggestions` attribute
  content: 'Browsers are starting to provide writing suggestions to users as they type on various editable fields across the
    web. While this is generally useful for users, there are cases when developers may want to turn off browser-provided writing
    assistance, such as extensions or sites that provide similar functionality of their own.


    The new attribute `writingsuggestions` has values of `true` or `false` that allow developers to turn on or off browser-provided
    writing suggestions. The attribute''s state for an element can also be inherited from ancestor elements, thereby allowing
    developers to control this ability at a per-element or per-document or sub-document scale.
