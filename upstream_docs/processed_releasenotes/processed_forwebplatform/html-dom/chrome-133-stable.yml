- title: The hint value of the popover attribute
  content: 'The Popover API specifies the behavior for two values of the popover attribute: auto and manual. This feature
    describes a third value, `popover=hint`. Hints, which are most often associated with "tooltip" type behaviors, have slightly
    different behaviors. Primarily, the difference is that a hint is subordinate to auto when opening nested stacks of popovers.
    So it is possible to open an unrelated hint popover while an existing stack of auto popovers stays open.


    The canonical example is that a `<select>` picker is open (`popover=auto`) and a hover-triggered tooltip (`popover=hint`)
    is shown. That action does not close the `<select>` picker.

    invoker relationships to create implicit anchor element references.

- title: Popover nested inside invoker shouldn't re-invoke it
  content: "In the following case clicking the button properly activates the popover, however, clicking on the popover itself\
    \ after that shouldn't close the popover.\n    \n    \n    <button popovertarget=foo>Activate\n      <div popover id=foo>Clicking\
    \ me shouldn't close me</div>\n    </button>\n    \n\nPreviously this happened, because the popover click bubbles to the\
    \ `<button>` and activates the invoker, which toggles the popover closed. This has now been changed to the expected behavior.\n\
