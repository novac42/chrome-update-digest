- title: Customizable `<select>` Element
  content: 'Customizable `<select>` allows developers to take complete control of the rendering of `<select>` elements by
    adding the `appearance: base-select` CSS property and value.


    This feature relies on the `SelectParserRelaxation` flag, which changes the HTML parser to allow more tags within the
    `<select>` tag.

- title: Select parser relaxation
  content: 'This change makes the HTML parser allow additional tags in `<select>` besides `<option>`, `<optgroup>`, and `<hr>`.


    This feature is gated by the temporary policy (`SelectParserRelaxationEnabled`). This is a temporary transition period,
    and the policy will stop working from Chrome 141.


    If you are experiencing problems that you believe are caused by this change, there''s a reverse origin trial to disable
    the parser relaxation.

- title: Dialog light dismiss
  content: "One of the nice features of the Popover API is its light dismiss behavior. This behavior is now part of `<dialog>`,\
    \ with a new `closedby` attribute controlling the behavior:\n\n  * `<dialog closedby=\"none\">`: No user-triggered closing\
    \ of dialogs at all.\n  * `<dialog closedby=\"closerequest\">`: Pressing `Esc` (or other close trigger) closes the dialog\n\
    \  * `<dialog closedby=\"any\">`: Clicking outside the dialog, or pressing `Esc`, closes the dialog. Akin to `popover=\"\
    auto\"` behavior.\n\n[Tracking bug #376516550](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/376516550) | [ChromeStatus.com entry](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5097714453577728)\
