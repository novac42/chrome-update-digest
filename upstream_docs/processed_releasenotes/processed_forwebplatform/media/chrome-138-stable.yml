- title: Add support for video frame orientation metadata to WebCodecs
  content: 'Introduces `rotation: int` and `flip: bool` values to various video related interfaces in WebCodecs so that developers
    can work with frame sources that have orientation (For example, Android cameras, certain media). The `VideoFrame` interface
    grows the ability to create VideoFrames with arbitrary rotation and flip as well as accessors for this information on
    the VideoFrame object. The `VideoDecoderConfig` object gains rotation and flip fields that are emitted on decoded VideoFrame
    objects automatically. The `VideoEncoder` class gains mechanisms for passing rotation and flip information from `encode()`
    to the VideoDecoderConfig emitted as part of `EncodedVideoChunkMetadata`. If `encode()` is called with frames with different
    orientations a nonfatal exception will be thrown. `configure()` may be used to reset the allowed orientation.
