- title: Summarizer API
  content: 'Summarizer API is a JavaScript API for producing summaries of input text, backed by an AI language model. Browsers
    and operating systems are increasingly expected to gain access to a language model. By exposing this built-in model, we
    avoid every website needing to download their own multi-gigabyte language model, or send input text to third-party APIs.
    The summarizer API in particular exposes a high-level API for interfacing with a language model in order to summarize
    inputs for a variety of use cases, in a way that does not depend on the specific language model in question. An enterprise
    policy (`GenAILocalFoundationalModelSettings`) is available to disable the underlying model downloading which would render
    this API unavailable.
