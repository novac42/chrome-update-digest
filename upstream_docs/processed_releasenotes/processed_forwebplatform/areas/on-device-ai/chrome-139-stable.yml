- title: On-device Web Speech API
  content: 'This feature adds on-device speech recognition support to the Web Speech API, allowing websites to ensure that
    neither audio nor transcribed speech are sent to a third-party service for processing.


    Websites can query the availability of on-device speech recognition for specific languages, prompt users to install the
    necessary resources for on-device speech recognition, and choose between on-device or cloud-based speech recognition as
    needed.
