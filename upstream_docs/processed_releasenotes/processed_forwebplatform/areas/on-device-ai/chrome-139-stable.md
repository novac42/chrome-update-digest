### Prompt API

An API designed for interacting with an AI language model using text, image, and audio inputs. It supports various use cases, from generating image captions and performing visual searches to transcribing audio, classifying sound events, generating text following specific instructions, and extracting information or insights from text. It supports structured outputs which ensure that responses adhere to a predefined format, typically expressed as a JSON schema, to enhance response conformance and facilitate seamless integration with downstream applications that require standardized output formats.

This API is also exposed in Chrome Extensions. This feature entry tracks the exposure on the web. An enterprise policy (`GenAILocalFoundationalModelSettings`) is available to disable the underlying model downloading which would render this API unavailable.
