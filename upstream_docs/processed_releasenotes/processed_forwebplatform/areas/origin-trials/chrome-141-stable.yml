- title: Local network access restrictions
  content: 'Chrome 141 [restricts the ability to make requests to the user''s local network](/blog/local-network-access),
    gated behind a permission prompt.


    This origin trial temporarily allows for access to resources on local networks to originate from non-secure contexts.
    This will give developers more time to migrate Local Network Access requests to originate from a secure context.

- title: Extend CSP `script-src` (also known as `script-src-v2`)
  content: 'This feature adds new keywords to the `script-src` Content Security Policy (CSP) directive. This adds two new
    hash-based allowlisting mechanisms: script sources based on hashes of URLs and contents of `eval()` and `eval()`-like
    functions. This is sometimes referred to as script-src-v2, although it is backward compatible with the existing script-src,
    and uses the same directive.


    Extending hashes to cover URL and `eval()` hashes lets developers set reasonably strict security policies by narrowly
    allowlisting scripts by their hashes even when script contents are subject to frequent changes, and known-safe contents
    of `eval()` without permitting unchecked use of `eval()` broadly.


    The new keywords override host-based script-src when provided. This allows a single header to be compatible with browsers
    that both do or do not implement the new keywords.

- title: WebAssembly custom descriptors
  content: 'Lets WebAssembly store data associated with source-level types more efficiently in new "custom descriptor" objects.
    These custom descriptors can be configured with prototypes for the WebAssembly objects of that source-level type. This
    lets you install methods on a WebAssembly object''s prototype chain and call them directly from JavaScript using normal
    method call syntax. The prototypes and methods can be configured declaratively using an imported built-in function.
