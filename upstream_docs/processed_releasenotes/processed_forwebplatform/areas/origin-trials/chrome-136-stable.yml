- title: 'Audio Output Devices API: setDefaultSinkId()'
  content: 'This feature adds `setDefaultSinkId()` to `MediaDevices`, which enables the top-level frame to change the default
    audio output device used by its subframes.

- title: Enable web applications to understand bimodal performance timings
  content: 'Web applications may suffer from bimodal distribution in page load performance, due to factors outside of the
    web application''s control. For example:

    - When a user agent first launches (a "cold start" scenario), it must perform many expensive initialization tasks that
    compete for resources on the system.

    - Browser extensions can affect the performance of a website. For instance, some extensions run additional code on every
    page you visit, which can increase CPU usage and result in slower response times.

    - When a machine is busy performing intensive tasks, it can lead to slower loading of web pages.


    A new `confidence` field on the `PerformanceNavigationTiming` object will enable developers to discern if the navigation
    timings are representative for their web application.

- title: Update of Canvas text rendering implementation
  content: 'This is not a web-exposed change. The implementation of `CanvasRenderingContext2D` `measureText()`, `fillText()`,
    and `strokeText()` has a drastic change. This might affect performance, so we''d like to run an origin trial so canvas-heavy
    applications can try out the new implementation.
