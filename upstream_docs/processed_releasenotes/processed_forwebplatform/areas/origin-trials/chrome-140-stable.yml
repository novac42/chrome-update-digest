- title: Enable incoming call notifications
  content: 'This feature extends the Notifications API to allow installed PWAs to send incoming call notificationsâ€”notifications
    with call-styled buttons and a ringtone. This extension helps VoIP web apps create more engaging experiences by making
    it easier for users to recognize and answer calling notifications. Additionally, this feature helps bridge the gap between
    native and web implementations of apps that have them both.

- title: Crash Reporting key-value API
  content: 'This feature introduces a new key-value API, tentatively `window.crashReport`, backed by a per-document map that
    holds data appended to crash reports.


    The data placed in this API''s backing map is sent in the `CrashReportBody` if any renderer process crashes occur on the
    site. This lets developers debug what specific state in their application might be causing a given crash.

- title: Add the `clipboardchange` event
  content: 'The `clipboardchange` event fires whenever a web app or any other system application changes the system clipboard
    contents. This allows web apps like remote desktop clients to keep their clipboards synchronized with the system clipboard.
    It provides an efficient alternative to polling the clipboard with JavaScript for changes.

- title: Enable `SharedWorker` on Android
  content: "The long-standing demand for SharedWorker support on Android stems from several needs expressed by web developers:\n\
    \n  * **Resource sharing and efficiency** : Developers aim to share a single WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) connection\
    \ across multiple tabs, thereby conserving resources.\n  * **Persistent resource management** : A requirement to share\
    \ and persist resources across tabs, particularly for technologies like WASM-based SQLite.\n  * **Closing a feature gap**\
    \ : Other major mobile browsers, including Safari on iOS and Firefox on Android, already support SharedWorker, making\
    \ Chrome on Android the last major browser to address this gap.\n\n[Origin Trial](https://developer.chrome.com/origintrials/#/register_trial/4101090410674257921)\
