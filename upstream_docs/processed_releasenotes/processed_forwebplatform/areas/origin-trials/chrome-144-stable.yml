- title: Enhanced Canvas API `TextMetrics`
  content: 'Expands the `TextMetrics` Canvas API to support selection rectangles, bounding box queries, and glyph cluster-based
    operations.


    This new functionality enables complex text editing applications with accurate selection, caret positioning, and hit testing.
    Additionally, cluster-based rendering facilitates sophisticated text effects, for example, independent character animations
    and styling.

- title: Context-aware media elements
  content: 'Context-aware media elements, are a declarative, user-activated control for accessing the starting and interacting
    with media streams.


    This addresses the long-standing problem of permission prompts being triggered directly from JavaScript without a strong
    signal of user intent. By embedding a browser-controlled element in the page, the user''s click provides a clear, intentional
    signal. This enables a much better prompt UX and, crucially, provides a recovery path for users who have previously denied
    the permission.


    **Note:** This feature was previously developed and tested in an Origin Trial as the more generic `<permission>` element.
    Based on feedback from developers and other browser vendors, it has evolved into capability-specific elements to provide
    a more tailored and powerful developer experience.
