- title: Reduce fingerprinting in Accept-Language header information
  content: 'Reduces the amount of information the `Accept-Language` header value string exposes in HTTP requests and in `navigator.languages`.
    Instead of sending a full list of the user''s preferred languages on every HTTP request using the `Accept-Language` header,
    Chrome only sends the user''s most preferred language.

- title: Randomize TCP port allocation on Windows
  content: 'This launch enables TCP port randomization on versions of Windows (2020 or later) where we don''t expect to see
    issues with re-use of prior ports occurring too fast (causing rejection due to timeouts on port re-use). The rapid port
    re-use issue arises from the Birthday problem, where the probability of randomly re-picking a port already seen rapidly
    converges with 100% for each new port chosen when compared to port re-use in a sequential model.
