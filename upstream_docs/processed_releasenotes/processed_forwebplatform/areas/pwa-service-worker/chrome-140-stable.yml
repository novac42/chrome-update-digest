- title: '`SharedWorker` script inherits controller for blob script URL'
  content: 'The specification states that workers should inherit controllers for the blob URL. However, existing code allows
    only dedicated workers to inherit the controller; shared workers don''t. This fixes Chrome''s behavior to align with the
    specification. The `SharedWorkerBlobURLFixEnabled` enterprise policy controls this feature.

- title: Add `ServiceWorkerStaticRouterTimingInfo`
  content: "This feature adds timing information for the ServiceWorker Static routing API, exposed in the navigation timing\
    \ API and resource timing API for developer use. ServiceWorker provides timing information to mark certain points in time.\n\
    \nThis feature adds two pieces of Static routing API-relevant timing information:\n\n  * `RouterEvaluationStart`: Time\
    \ to start matching a request with registered router rules.\n  * `CacheLookupStart`: Time to start looking up the cache\
    \ storage if the source is `\"cache\"`.\n\nAdditionally, this feature adds two pieces of router source information: the\
    \ matched router source and the final router source.\n\n[Tracking bug #41496865](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/41496865)\
