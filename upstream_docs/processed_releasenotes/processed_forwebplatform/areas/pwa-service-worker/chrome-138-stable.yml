- title: ServiceWorker support for Speculation Rules Prefetch
  content: 'This feature enables ServiceWorker-controlled prefetches, that is a speculation rules prefetch to URLs controlled
    by a Service Worker. Previously, the prefetch is cancelled upon detecting a controlling Service Worker, thus subsequent
    navigation to the prefetch target is served by the non-prefetch path. This feature will enable the prefetch request to
    go through the Service Worker''s fetch handler and the response with the Service Worker interception is cached in the
    prefetch cache, resulting in a subsequent navigation being served by the prefetch cache. Use the enterprise policy `PrefetchWithServiceWorkerEnabled`
    to control this feature.
