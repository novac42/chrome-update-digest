- title: Integrity Policy for scripts
  content: 'Subresource-Integrity (SRI) enables developers to make sure the assets they intend to load are indeed the assets
    they are loading. But there''s no current way for developers to be sure that all of their scripts are validated using
    SRI. The Integrity-Policy header gives developers the ability to assert that every resource of a given type needs to be
    integrity-checked. If a resource of that type is attempted to be loaded without integrity metadata, that attempt will
    fail and trigger a violation report.
