- title: Strict Same Origin Policy for Storage Access API
  content: 'Adjusts the Storage Access API semantics to strictly follow the Same Origin Policy with regard to security. That
    is, using `document.requestStorageAccess()` in a frame only attaches cookies to requests to the iframe''s origin (not
    site) by default.


    **Note:** The `CookiesAllowedForUrls` policy or Storage Access Headers may still be used to unblock cross-site cookies.

- title: Signature-based Integrity
  content: 'This feature provides web developers with a mechanism to verify the provenance of resources they depend upon,
    creating a technical foundation for trust in a site''s dependencies. In short: servers can sign responses with a Ed25519
    key pair, and web developers can require the user agent to verify the signature using a specific public key. This offers
    a helpful addition to URL-based checks offered by Content Security Policy on the one hand, and Subresource Integrity''s
    content-based checks on the other.
