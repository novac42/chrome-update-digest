- title: The `securePaymentConfirmationAvailability` API
  content: 'This is a JavaScript API to provide an easier way to check if the Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC) feature is
    available. With this API, the only way to determine SPC''s availability was to create a `PaymentRequest` with the required
    parameters, which is clunky and difficult in the case where a developer wants to check for SPC before starting to process
    a payment.
