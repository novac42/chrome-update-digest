- title: Allow more characters in JavaScript DOM APIs
  content: 'The HTML parser has always (or for a long time) allowed elements and attributes to have a wide variety of valid
    characters and names, but the JavaScript DOM APIs to create the same elements and attributes are more strict and don''t
    match the parser.


    This change relaxes the validation of the javascript DOM APIs to match the HTML parser.

- title: Randomize TCP port allocation on Windows
  content: 'This launch enables TCP port randomization on versions of Windows (2020 or later) where we don''t expect to see
    issues with re-use of prior ports occurring too fast (causing rejection due to timeouts on port re-use). The rapid port
    re-use issue arises from the Birthday problem, where the probability of randomly re-picking a port already seen rapidly
    converges with 100% for each new port chosen when compared to port re-use in a sequential model.
