- title: '`Uint8Array` to and from base64 and hex'
  content: 'Base64 is a common way to represent arbitrary binary data as ASCII. JavaScript has `Uint8Arrays` for binary data.
    However, it lacks a built-in mechanism to encode that data as base64, or to take base64 data and produce a corresponding
    `Uint8Array`. This feature adds the ability and methods for converting between hex strings and `Uint8Arrays`.

- title: View transition finished promise timing change
  content: 'The current finished promise timing happens within the rendering lifecycle steps. This means that code that runs
    as a result of promise resolution happens after the visual frame that removes the view transition has been produced. This
    can cause a flicker at the end of the animation if the script moves styles to preserve a visually similar state. This
    change resolves the issue by moving the view transition cleanup steps to run asynchronously after the lifecycle is completed.
