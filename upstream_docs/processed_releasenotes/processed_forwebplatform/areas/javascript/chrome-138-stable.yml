- title: Update QuotaExceededError to a DOMException derived interface
  content: 'Previously, when the web platform wants to tell you when you''ve exceeded quota, it will use `DOMException` with
    the specific name property set to `QuotaExceededError`. However this does not allow carrying additional information. This
    proposes removing "QuotaExceededError" from the list of built-in DOMException names, and instead creates a class name
    `QuotaExceededError` from the list of built-in DOMException and has the additional optional properties `quota` and `requested`.
    We propose all instances of specs that throw "QuotaExceededError" `DOMException`s get upgraded to instead throw `QuotaExceededError`s.
    For now, such specs would leave the `quota` and `requested` properties at their default value of null, but they could
    eventually upgrade to include that data, if it''s useful for their use case (and isn''t, e.g., a privacy leak).
