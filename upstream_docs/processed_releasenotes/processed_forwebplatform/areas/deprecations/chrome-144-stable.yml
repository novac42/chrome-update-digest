- title: 'Deprecate and remove: Private Aggregation API'
  content: 'The Private Aggregation API is a generic mechanism for measuring aggregate, cross-site data in a privacy-preserving
    manner. It was originally designed for a future without third-party cookies.


    Following Chrome''s announcement that the current approach to third-party cookies will be maintained, Chrome plans to
    deprecate and remove the Private Aggregation API (along with certain other Privacy Sandbox APIs, as outlined on the Privacy
    Sandbox feature status page). This API is only exposed through the Shared Storage and Protected Audience APIs, which are
    also planned for deprecation and removal. Therefore, no additional work is required for Private Aggregation.

- title: Externally loaded entities in XML parsing
  content: 'Chrome synchronously fetches external XML entities or DTDs and incorporates them into parsing under specific circumstances.
    This document proposes removing this functionality.


    For example, `http/tests/security/contentTypeOptions/xml-external-entity.xml` shows how external entities can be defined
    in the trailing part of the `DOCTYPE` statement. These entities then refer to resources that are synchronously loaded
    and included as context when parsing XML.


    Another syntax example is a `DOCTYPE` that, using the `SYSTEM` keyword followed by a URL, points to a DTD that contains
    additional entity definitions.


    The parser passes up such external load requests.


    According to the XML specification, non-validating processors are not required to read external entities.


    Chrome plans to deprecate loading external entity definitions in XML documents that don''t use XSLT.
