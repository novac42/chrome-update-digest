- title: 'Stop sending `Purpose: prefetch` header from prefetches and prerenders'
  content: 'Prefetches and prerenders now use the `Sec-Purpose` header, therefore the legacy `Purpose: prefetch` header is
    being removed.


    This will be scoped to speculation rules `prefetch`, speculation rules `prerender`, `<link rel=prefetch>`, and Chromium''s
    non-standard `<link rel=prerender>`.

- title: Deprecate special font size rules for H1 within some elements
  content: 'The HTML spec contains [a list of special rules](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#sections-and-headings)
    for `<h1>` tags nested within `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<nav>`, or `<section>` tags:


    These special rules are deprecated, because they cause accessibility issues. Namely, they visually reduce the font size
    for nested `<h1>` elements so that they "look" like `<h2>` elements, but nothing in the accessibility tree reflects this
    demotion.
