- title: Remove nonstandard `getUserMedia` audio constraints
  content: 'Blink supports a number of nonstandard `goog`-prefixed constraints for `getUserMedia` from some time before constraints
    were properly standardized.


    Usage has gone down significantly to between 0.000001% to 0.0009% (depending on the constraint) and some of them don''t
    even have an effect due to changes in the Chromium audio-capture stack. Soon none of them will have any effect due to
    other upcoming changes.


    We don''t expect any major regressions due to this change. Applications using these constraints will continue to work,
    but will get audio with default settings (as if no constraints were passed). They can opt to migrate to standard constraints.
