  content: 'This feature exposes _find-in-page_ search result styling to authors as a highlight pseudo-element, similar to
    selection and spelling errors. This lets developers change foreground and background colors or add text decorations. This
    is especially useful if browser defaults have insufficient contrast with page colors or are otherwise unsuitable.

- title: Non-tree-scoped container-name matching
  content: 'Ignore tree-scope when matching `container-name` for `@container` queries.


    Previously, `container-name` matching for container queries used tree-scoped names or references for matching. This meant
    the same name didn''t match if the `@container` rule and the `container-type` property originated from different trees,
    such that the `container-type` declaration came from an inner shadow tree.


    With this change, container names match regardless of `@container` rule or `container-type` declaration origins.

    property lets sites choose one of these shapes for the caret inside editable elements, or leave the choice to the browser.
    The recognized property values are `auto`, `bar`, `block`, and `underscore`.

- title: View transitions `waitUntil()` method
  content: 'View transitions automatically construct a pseudo-element tree to display and animate participating elements in
    the transition. Per the specification, this subtree is constructed when the view transition starts animating and is destroyed
    when the animations associated with all view transition pseudo-elements are in the finished state (or more precisely,
    in a non-running, non-paused state).


    This works for most cases and provides a seamless experience for developers. However, for more advanced cases, this is
    insufficient because developers sometimes want the view transition pseudo-tree to persist beyond the animation finish
    state.


    One example is tying view transitions with Scroll Driven Animations. When a scroll timeline controls the animation, the
    subtree shouldn''t be destroyed when the animations finish because scrolling back should still animate the pseudo elements.


    To enable advanced uses of view transition, this intent adds a `waitUntil()` function on the `ViewTransition` object that
    takes a promise. This promise delays destruction of the pseudo-tree until it settles.
