- title: CSS typed arithmetic
  content: 'Typed arithmetic lets you write expressions in CSS such as `calc(10em / 1px)` or `calc(20% / 0.5em * 1px)`. This
    is useful in, for example, typography, as it lets you convert a typed value into an untyped one and reuse it for number
    accepting properties. Another use case is to multiply the unitless value by another type. For example, you can now cast
    from pixels to degrees.

- title: CSS `caret-animation` property
  content: 'Chromium supports animation of the `caret-color` property. However, when animated, the caret''s default blinking
    behavior interferes with the animation.


    The CSS `caret-animation` property has two possible values: `auto` and `manual`. `auto` means browser default (blinking),
    and `manual` means the developer controls the caret animation. Additionally, users who are disturbed by or have adverse
    reactions to blinking or flashing visuals can disable the blinking with a user stylesheet.

  content: 'The `highlightsFromPoint` API lets developers interact with custom highlights. It detects which highlights exist
    at a specific point within a document. This interactivity is valuable for complex web features where multiple highlights
    may overlap or exist within shadow DOM. By providing precise point-based highlight detection, the API empowers developers
    to manage dynamic interactions with custom highlights more effectively. For example, developers can respond to user clicks
    or hover events on highlighted regions to trigger custom tooltips, context menus, or other interactive features.

- title: Propagate viewport `overscroll-behavior` from root
  content: 'This change propagates `overscroll-behavior` from the root instead of the body.


    The CSS working group resolved not to propagate properties from the `<body>` to the viewport. Instead, properties of the
    viewport propagate from the root (`<html>`) element. As such, `overscroll-behavior` should propagate from the root element.
    However, Chrome has had a longstanding issue: it propagates `overscroll-behavior` from the `<body>` rather than the root.
    This behavior is not interoperable with other browsers. This change makes Chrome comply with the specification and become
    interoperable with other implementations.

  content: 'CSS allows developers to adjust a font''s weight, width, slant, and other axes using the `font-variation-settings`
    property on individual elements. However, Chromium-based browsers lack support for this property within `@font-face` declarations.
    This feature supports the string-based syntax for `font-variation-settings` as defined in CSS Fonts Level 4. Invalid or
    unrecognized feature tags are ignored per specification. No binary or non-standard forms are supported. Variable fonts
    are becoming more widely adopted for both performance and typographic flexibility. Adding support for this descriptor
    in Chromium enhances control, reduces repetition, and supports a more scalable, modern approach to web typography.
