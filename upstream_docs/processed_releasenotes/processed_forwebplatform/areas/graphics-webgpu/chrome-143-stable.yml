- title: Texture component swizzle
  content: "It's now possible to rearrange or replace the color components from texture's red, green, blue, and alpha channels\
    \ when accessed by a shader.\n\nWhen the [`\"texture-component-swizzle\"`](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#dom-gpufeaturename-texture-component-swizzle)\
    \ feature is available in a GPUAdapter, request a GPUDevice with this feature, and create a GPUTextureView by calling\
    \ `createView()` with a new `swizzle` option. This value is a string of length four, with each character mapping to the\
    \ view's red, green, blue, and alpha components, respectively. Each character can be either:\n\n  * `\"r\"`: Take its\
    \ value from the red channel of the texture.\n  * `\"g\"`: Take its value from the green channel of the texture.\n  *\
    \ `\"b\"`: Take its value from the blue channel of the texture.\n  * `\"a\"`: Take its value from the alpha channel of\
    \ the texture.\n  * `\"0\"`: Force its value to 0.\n  * `\"1\"`: Force its value to 1.\n\nSee the following snippet and\
    \ [chromestatus entry](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5110223547269120).\n    \n    \n    const adapter = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter();\n\
    \    if (!adapter.features.has(\"texture-component-swizzle\")) {\n      throw new Error(\"Texture component swizzle support\
    \ is not available\");\n    }\n    // Explicitly request texture component swizzle support.\n    const device = await\
    \ adapter.requestDevice({\n      requiredFeatures: [\"texture-component-swizzle\"],\n    });\n    \n    // ... Assuming\
    \ myTexture is a GPUTexture with a single red channel.\n    \n    // Map the view's red, green, blue components to myTexture's\
    \ red channel\n    // and force the view's alpha component to 1 so that the shader sees it as\n    // a grayscale image.\n\
    \    const view = myTexture.createView({ swizzle: \"rrr1\" });\n    \n    // Send the appropriate commands to the GPU..."

- title: Remove bgra8unorm read-only storage texture usage
  content: As previously [announced](/blog/new-in-webgpu-140#deprecate_bgra8unorm_read-only_storage_texture_usage), using
    `"bgra8unorm"` format with read-only storage textures is now removed. The WebGPU specification explicitly disallows this,
    and its prior allowance in Chrome was a bug, as this format is intended for write-only access and is not portable. See
    [issue 427681156](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/427681156).
