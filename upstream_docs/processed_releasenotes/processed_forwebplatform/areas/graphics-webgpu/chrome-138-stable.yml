- title: Shorthand for Using Buffer as a Binding Resource
  content: "Developers can now use a `GPUBuffer` directly as a `GPUBindingResource`. This simplifies binding and makes it\
    \ consistent with other binding types:\n\n```javascript\nconst bindGroup = myDevice.createBindGroup({\n  layout: myPipeline.getBindGroupLayout(0),\n\
    \  entries: [\n    { binding: 0, resource: mySampler },\n    { binding: 1, resource: myTextureView },\n    { binding:\
    \ 2, resource: myExternalTexture },\n    { binding: 3, resource: myBuffer }, // Simplified syntax\n    { binding: 4, resource:\
    \ { buffer: myOtherBuffer, offset: 42 } },\n  ],\n});\n```"
