### FedCMâ€”Support showing third-party iframe origins in the UI

Before Chrome 142, FedCM always showed the top-level site in its UI.

This works well when the iframe is conceptually first-party (for example, `foo.com` might have an iframe `foostatic.com`, which is not meaningful to the user).

But if the iframe is actually third-party, it is better to show the iframe origin in the UI so users better understand who they are sharing their credentials with. For example, a photo editor might be embedded in a book publishing web app and might want to let users access files they stored before with the photo editor. This capability is now available.

### Stricter `*+json` MIME token validation for JSON modules

Reject JSON module script responses whose MIME type's type or subtype contains non-HTTP token code points (for example, spaces) when matched with `*+json`. This aligns with the MIME Sniffing specification and other engines. It is part of the Interop2025 modules focus area.

### Web Speech API contextual biasing

This feature enables websites to support contextual biasing for speech recognition by adding a recognition phrase list to the Web Speech API.

Developers can provide a list of phrases as well as updating them to apply a bias to the speech recognition models in favor of those phrases. This helps improve accuracy and relevance for domain-specific and personalized speech recognition.

### Media session: add reason to `enterpictureinpicture` action details

Adds `enterPictureInPictureReason` to the `MediaSessionActionDetails` sent to the `enterpictureinpicture` action in the Media Session API. This allows developers to distinguish between `enterpictureinpicture` actions triggered explicitly by the user (e.g. from a button in the user agent) and `enterpictureinpicture` actions triggered automatically by the user agent due to the content becoming occluded.
