- title: '`ReadableStreamBYOBReader` `min` option'
  content: 'This feature introduces a `min` option to the existing `ReadableStreamBYOBReader.read(view)` method. The method
    already accepts an `ArrayBufferView` into which it reads data, but currently does not guarantee how many elements are
    written before the read resolves. By specifying a `min` value, you can require that the stream wait until at least that
    many elements are available before resolving the read. This improves upon the current behavior, where reads may resolve
    with fewer elements than the view can hold.

    related applications are installed. Sites are only allowed to use this API if the application has an established association
    with the web origin.

- title: Http cookie prefix
  content: 'In some cases, it''s important to distinguish on the server side between cookies set by the server and those set
    by the client. One such case involves cookies normally always set by the server. However, unexpected code (such as an
    XSS exploit, a malicious extension, or a commit from a confused developer) might set them on the client. This proposal
    adds a signal that lets servers make such a distinction. More specifically, it defines the `__Http` and `__HostHttp` prefixes,
    which ensure a cookie is not set on the client side using script.
