- title: 'Blob URL Partitioning: Fetching/Navigation'
  content: 'As a continuation of Storage Partitioning, Chrome has implemented partitioning of Blob URL access by Storage Key
    (top-level site, frame origin, and the has-cross-site-ancestor boolean), with the exception of top-level navigations which
    will remain partitioned only by frame origin. This behavior is similar to what''s currently implemented by both Firefox
    and Safari, and aligns Blob URL usage with the partitioning scheme used by other storage APIs as part of Storage Partitioning.
    In addition, Chrome now enforces noopener on renderer-initiated top-level navigations to Blob URLs where the corresponding
    site is cross-site to the top-level site performing the navigation. This aligns Chrome with similar behavior in Safari,
    and the relevant specs have been updated to reflect these changes.


    **Note:** This change can be temporarily reverted by setting the `PartitionedBlobURLUsage` policy. The policy will be
    deprecated when the other storage partitioning related enterprise policies are deprecated.

- title: Call stacks in crash reports from unresponsive web pages
  content: 'This feature captures the JavaScript call stack when a web page becomes unresponsive due to JavaScript code running
    an infinite loop or other very long computation. This helps developers to identify the cause of the unresponsiveness and
    fix it more easily. The JavaScript call stack is included in the crash reporting API when the reason is unresponsive.
