- title: Translator API
  content: 'A JavaScript API to provide language translation capabilities to web pages. Browsers are increasingly offering
    language translation to their users. Such translation capabilities can also be useful to web developers. This is especially
    the case when browser''s built-in translation abilities cannot help. An enterprise policy (`GenAILocalFoundationalModelSettings`)
    is available to disable the underlying model downloading which would render this API unavailable.

- title: Language Detector API
  content: 'A JavaScript API for detecting the language of text, with confidence levels. An important supplement to translation
    is language detection. This can be combined with translation, for example, taking user input in an unknown language and
    translating it to a specific target language. Browsers today often already have language detection capabilities, and we
    want to offer them to web developers through a JavaScript API, supplementing the translation API. An enterprise policy
    (`GenAILocalFoundationalModelSettings`) is available to disable the underlying model downloading which would render this
    API unavailable.

- title: Summarizer API
  content: 'Summarizer API is a JavaScript API for producing summaries of input text, backed by an AI language model. Browsers
    and operating systems are increasingly expected to gain access to a language model. By exposing this built-in model, we
    avoid every website needing to download their own multi-gigabyte language model, or send input text to third-party APIs.
    The summarizer API in particular exposes a high-level API for interfacing with a language model in order to summarize
    inputs for a variety of use cases, in a way that does not depend on the specific language model in question. An enterprise
    policy (`GenAILocalFoundationalModelSettings`) is available to disable the underlying model downloading which would render
    this API unavailable.

- title: Escape < and > in attributes on serialization
  content: 'Escape `<` and `>` in values of attributes on serialization. This mitigates the risk of mutation XSS attacks,
    which occur when value of an attribute is interpreted as a start tag token after being serialized and re-parsed.
