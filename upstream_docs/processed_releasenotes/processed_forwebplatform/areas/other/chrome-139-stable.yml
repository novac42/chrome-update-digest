  content: 'By default, [WebGPU compatibility mode](https://chromestatus.com/feature/6436406437871616) is not enabled in Chrome,
    but it can be experimented with in Chrome 139 by explicitly enabling the functionality. You can activate it locally by
    enabling the "Experimental Web Platform Features" [flag](/docs/web-platform/chrome-flags#chromeflags) at `chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features`.


    To enable it for all visitors to your app, an [origin trial](/origintrials#/view_trial/1489002626799370241) is underway
    and set to end in Chrome 145 (Apr 21, 2026). To participate in the trial, refer to the [Get started with origin trials](/docs/web-platform/origin-trials#take_part_in_an_origin_trial)
