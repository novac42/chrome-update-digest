- title: Allow viewports to extend past the render targets bounds
  content: "The requirements for viewport validation have been relaxed to allow viewports to go beyond the render target boundaries.\
    \ This is especially useful for drawing 2D elements such as UI that may extend outside the current viewport. See [issue\
    \ 390162929](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/390162929).\n    \n    \n    const passEncoder = myCommandEncoder.beginRenderPass({\n\
    \      colorAttachments: [\n        {\n          view: myColorTexture.createView(),\n          loadOp: \"clear\",\n  \
    \        storeOp: \"store\",\n        },\n      ],\n    });\n    \n    // Set a viewport that extends past the render\
    \ target's bounds by 8 pixels\n    // in all directions.\n    passEncoder.setViewport(\n      /*x=*/ -8,\n      /*y=*/\
    \ -8,\n      /*width=*/ myColorTexture.width + 16,\n      /*height=*/ myColorTexture.height + 16,\n      /*minDepth=*/\
    \ 0,\n      /*maxDepth=*/ 1,\n    );\n    \n    // Draw geometry and complete the render pass as usual."
