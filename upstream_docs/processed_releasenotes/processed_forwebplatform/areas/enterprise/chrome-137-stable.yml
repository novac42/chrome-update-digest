  content: 'Chrome Enterprise is enhancing security monitoring and incident response capabilities by collecting and reporting
    local and remote IP addresses and sending those IP addresses to the Security Investigation Logs (SIT). In addition, Chrome
    Enterprise will allow admins to optionally send the IP addresses to first-party and third-party SIEM providers through
    the Chrome Enterprise Reporting connector. This is available for Chrome Enterprise Core customers.
