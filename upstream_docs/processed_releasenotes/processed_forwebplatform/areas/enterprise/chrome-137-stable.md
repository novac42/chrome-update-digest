## Enterprise

### IP address logging and reporting

Chrome Enterprise is enhancing security monitoring and incident response capabilities by collecting and reporting local and remote IP addresses and sending those IP addresses to the Security Investigation Logs (SIT). In addition, Chrome Enterprise will allow admins to optionally send the IP addresses to first-party and third-party SIEM providers through the Chrome Enterprise Reporting connector. This is available for Chrome Enterprise Core customers.
