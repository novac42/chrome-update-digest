- title: '`XRVisibilityMaskChange`'
  content: 'Adds an `XRVisibilityMaskChange` event that provides a list of vertices and a list of indices to represent the
    mesh of the visible portion of the user''s viewport. This data can then limit the amount of the viewport drawn to, which
    improves performance. To better support this event, `XRView` objects are also given unique identifiers to allow easier
    pairing with the associated masks. This extends the core WebXR specification.
