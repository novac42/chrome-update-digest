- content: 'As a continuation of Storage Partitioning, Chrome has implemented partitioning
    of Blob URL access by Storage Key (top-level site, frame origin, and the has-cross-site-ancestor
    boolean), with the exception of top-level navigations which will remain partitioned
    only by frame origin. This behavior is similar to what''s currently implemented
    by both Firefox and Safari, and aligns Blob URL usage with the partitioning scheme
    used by other storage APIs as part of Storage Partitioning. In addition, Chrome
    now enforces noopener on renderer-initiated top-level navigations to Blob URLs
    where the corresponding site is cross-site to the top-level site performing the
    navigation. This aligns Chrome with similar behavior in Safari, and the relevant
    specs have been updated to reflect these changes.


    **Note:** This change can be temporarily reverted by setting the `PartitionedBlobURLUsage`
    policy. The policy will be deprecated when the other storage partitioning related
    enterprise policies are deprecated.

    and fix it more easily. The JavaScript call stack is included in the crash reporting
