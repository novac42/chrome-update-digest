- content: 'Correct the error type thrown during WebAuthn credential creation for
    payment credentials. Due to a historic specification mismatch, creating a payment
    credential in a cross-origin iframe without a user activation would throw a `SecurityError`
    instead of a `NotAllowedError`, which is what is thrown for non-payment credentials.
    This is a breaking change, albeit a niche one. Code that previously detected the
    type of error thrown (for example, `e instanceof SecurityError`) is affected.
    Code that just generally handles errors during credential creation (for example,
    `catch (e)`) will continue to function correctly.
