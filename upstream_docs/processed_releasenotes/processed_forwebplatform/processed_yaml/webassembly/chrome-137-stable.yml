- content: 'JavaScript Promise Integration (JSPI) is an API that allows WebAssembly
    applications to integrate with JavaScript Promises. It allows a WebAssembly program
    to act as the generator of a Promise, and it allows the WebAssembly program to
    interact with Promise-bearing APIs. In particular, when an application uses JSPI
    to call a Promise-bearing (JavaScript) API, the WebAssembly code is suspended;
    and the original caller to the WebAssembly program is given a Promise that will
    be fulfilled when the WebAssembly program finally completes.

- content: 'Improves the performance of compiled WebAssembly code by informing the
    engine that a particular branch instruction is very likely to take a specific
    path. This allows the engine to make better decisions for code layout (improving
    instruction cache hits) and register allocation.
