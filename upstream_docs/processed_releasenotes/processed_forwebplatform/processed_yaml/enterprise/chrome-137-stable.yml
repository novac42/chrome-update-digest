    capabilities by collecting and reporting local and remote IP addresses and sending
    those IP addresses to the Security Investigation Logs (SIT). In addition, Chrome
    Enterprise will allow admins to optionally send the IP addresses to first-party
    and third-party SIEM providers through the Chrome Enterprise Reporting connector.
    This is available for Chrome Enterprise Core customers.
