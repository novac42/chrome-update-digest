- title: The `securePaymentConfirmationAvailability` API
  content: 'This is a JavaScript API to provide an easier way to check if the Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC) feature is
    available. With this API, the only way to determine SPC''s availability was to create a `PaymentRequest` with the required
    parameters, which is clunky and difficult in the case where a developer wants to check for SPC before starting to process
    a payment.

- title: On-device Web Speech API
  content: 'This feature adds on-device speech recognition support to the Web Speech API, allowing websites to ensure that
    neither audio nor transcribed speech are sent to a third-party service for processing.


    Websites can query the availability of on-device speech recognition for specific languages, prompt users to install the
    necessary resources for on-device speech recognition, and choose between on-device or cloud-based speech recognition as
    needed.
