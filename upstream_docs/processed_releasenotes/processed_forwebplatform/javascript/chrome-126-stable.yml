- title: '`visualViewport` `onscrollend` support'
  content: 'The `scrollend` JavaScript event fires to signal that a scrolling operation has come to an end.


    The `visualViewport` interface includes an `onscrollend` event handler that should be invoked when a scrolling operation
    on the `visualViewport` has ended. Chrome already supports adding a scrollend event listener through `visualViewport.addEventListener("scrollend")`.
    This just makes it possible to also add an event listener using `visualViewport.onscrollend`.
