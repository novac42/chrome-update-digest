- title: WebXR depth sensing performance improvements
  content: 'Exposes several new mechanisms to customize the behavior of the depth sensing feature within a WebXR session,
    with the goal of improving the performance of the generation or consumption of the depth buffer.


    The key mechanisms exposed are: the ability to request the raw or smooth depth buffer, the ability to request that the
    runtime stop or resume providing the depth buffer, and the ability to expose a depth buffer that does not align with the
    user''s view exactly, so that the user agent does not need to perform unnecessary re-projections every frame.
