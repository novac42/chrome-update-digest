    of restricting content to the SDR range of the display) as the default, and `extended` (not imposing this restriction)
    as a new behavior. This allows WebGPU content to use the full range of a display.

- title: HDR support with canvas tone mapping mode
  content: "Web developers have limited options for delivering HDR content, relying primarily on `<img>` and `<video>` elements.\
    \ The `<canvas>` element, however, remains restricted to SDR. Generating dynamic HDR content within a canvas requires\
    \ encoding its contents as an HDR image before displaying it (for an example see this [demo](https://gkjohnson.github.io/three-gpu-pathtracer/example/bundle/hdr.html)).\n\
    \nThe new [`GPUCanvasToneMappingMode`](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/#gpucanvastonemappingmode) parameter in the WebGPU\
    \ canvas configuration now allows WebGPU to draw colors brighter than white (`#FFFFFF`). It does so through the following\
    \ modes:\n\n  * `\"standard\"`: The default behavior restricts content to the SDR range of the screen. This mode is accomplished\
    \ by clamping all color values in the color space of the screen to the `[0, 1]` interval.\n\n  * `\"extended\"`: Unlocks\
    \ the full HDR range of the screen. This mode matches `\"standard\"` in the `[0, 1]` range of the screen. Clamping or\
    \ projection is done to the extended dynamic range of the screen but not `[0, 1]`.\n\nThe following code snippet shows\
    \ you to configure a canvas for high dynamic range.\n    \n    \n    const adapter = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter();\n\
    \    const device = await adapter.requestDevice();\n    \n    const canvas = document.querySelector(\"canvas\");\n   \
    \ const context = canvas.getContext(\"webgpu\");\n    \n    context.configure({\n      device,\n      format: \"rgba16float\"\
    ,\n      toneMapping: { mode: \"extended\" },\n    });\n    \n\nExplore HDR with WebGPU by checking out the [Particles\
    \ (HDR) sample](https://webgpu.github.io/webgpu-samples/?sample=particles) and [WebGPU HDR example](https://ccameron-chromium.github.io/webgpu-hdr/example.html),\
    \ and see the [chromestatus entry](https://chromestatus.com/feature/6196313866895360).\n\n![A laptop with an HDR screen\

- title: Expanded subgroups support
  content: "Following the announcement of [subgroups experimentation](/blog/new-in-webgpu-128#experimenting_with_subgroups),\
    \ the subgroup built-ins functions are now available for use in both compute shaders and fragment shaders. They are no\
    \ longer restricted to just compute shaders. See [issue 354738715](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/354738715).\n\n\
    Note that the `subgroup_size` built-in value is currently [buggy](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/361593660) in fragment\
    \ shaders. Avoid it for now.\n\nFurthermore, the following subgroup built-ins functions have been added:\n\n  * `subgroupAdd(value)`:\
    \ Returns the summation of all active invocations `value`s across the subgroup.\n  * `subgroupExclusiveAdd(value)`: Returns\
    \ the exclusive scan summation of all active invocations `value`s across the subgroup.\n  * `subgroupMul(value)`: Returns\
    \ the multiplication of all active invocations `value`s across the subgroup.\n  * `subgroupExclusiveMul(value)`: Returns\
    \ the exclusive scan multiplication of all active invocations `value`s across the subgroup.   \n  \n\n  * `subgroupAnd(value)`:\
    \ Returns the binary AND of all active invocations `value`s across the subgroup.\n  * `subgroupOr(value)`: Returns the\
    \ binary OR of all active invocations `value`s across the subgroup.\n  * `subgroupXor(value)`: Returns the binary XOR\
    \ of all active invocations `value`s across the subgroup.   \n  \n\n  * `subgroupMin(value)`: Returns the minimal value\
    \ of all active invocations `value`s across the subgroup.\n  * `subgroupMax(value)`: Returns the maximal value of all\
    \ active invocations `value`s across the subgroup.   \n  \n\n  * `subgroupAll(value)`: Returns true if `value` is true\
    \ for all active invocations in the subgroup.\n  * `subgroupAny(value)`: Returns true if `value` is true for any active\
    \ invocation in the subgroup.   \n  \n\n  * `subgroupElect()`: Returns true if this invocation has the lowest `subgroup_invocation_id`\
    \ among active invocations in the subgroup.\n  * `subgroupBroadcastFirst(value)`: Broadcasts `value` from the active invocation\
    \ with the lowest `subgroup_invocation_id` in the subgroup to all other active invocations.   \n  \n\n  * `subgroupShuffle(value,\
    \ id)`: Returns `value` from the active invocation whose `subgroup_invocation_id` matches `id`.\n  * `subgroupShuffleXor(value,\
    \ mask)`: Returns `value` from the active invocation whose `subgroup_invocation_id` matches `subgroup_invocation_id ^\
    \ mask`. `mask` must be dynamically uniform.\n  * `subgroupShuffleUp(value, delta)`: Returns `value` from the active invocation\
    \ whose `subgroup_invocation_id` matches `subgroup_invocation_id - delta`.\n  * `subgroupShuffleDown(value, delta)`: Returns\
    \ `value` from the active invocation whose `subgroup_invocation_id` matches `subgroup_invocation_id + delta`.   \n  \n\
    \n  * `quadBroadcast(value, id)`: Broadcasts `value` from the quad invocation with id equal to `id`. `id` must be a constant-expression.\n\
    \  * `quadSwapX(value)`: Swaps `value` between invocations in the quad in the X direction.\n  * `quadSwapY(value)`: Swaps\
    \ `value` between invocations in the quad in the Y direction.\n  * `quadSwapDiagonal(value)`: Swaps `value` between invocations\
    \ in the quad diagonally."

  content: 'Chrome will block access to IP address `0.0.0.0` in advance of Private Network Access (PNA) completely rolling
    out.


    Chrome is deprecating direct access to private network endpoints from public websites as part of the [PNA specification](/blog/private-network-access-preflight).
    Services listening on localhost (`127.0.0.0/8`) are considered private according to the specification. Chrome''s PNA protection
    can be bypassed using the IP address `0.0.0.0` to access services listening on the localhost on macOS and Linux.


    This can also be abused in DNS rebinding attacks targeting a web application listening on the localhost.


    This release of Chrome removes three features.

- title: Remove non-standard declarative shadow DOM serialization
  content: 'The prototype implementation of declarative shadow DOM contained a method called `getInnerHTML()` used to serialize
    DOM trees containing shadow roots. That part of the prototype was not standardized with the rest of declarative shadow
    dom, and instead a replacement was designed—`getHTML()`.


    Therefore the old `getInnerHTML()` method is now being removed from Chrome, you should use [`getHTML()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/getHTML)
    as a replacement, which will soon be interoperable across browsers.
