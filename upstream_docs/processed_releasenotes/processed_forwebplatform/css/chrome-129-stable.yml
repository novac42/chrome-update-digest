- title: CSS interpolate-size property and calc-size() function
  content: 'The CSS `interpolate-size` property lets a page opt into animations and transitions of CSS intrinsic sizing keywords
    such as `auto`, `min-content`, and `fit-content`, in the cases where those keywords can be animated.


    The CSS `calc-size()` function is a CSS function similar to `calc()`, however it also supports operations on exactly one
    supported sizing keyword. Supported sizing keywords are `auto`, `min-content`, `max-content`, and `fit-content`. Other
    sizing keywords that may be supported in the future include `stretch` (currently supported as prefixed `-webkit-fill-available`)
    and `contain`. This function is used to represent the values in the middle of the animations allowed by the `interpolate-size`
    property.

- title: Update CSS backdrop-filter to use mirror edgeMode
  content: 'The `backdrop-filter` CSS property applies one or more filters to the _backdrop_ of an element. The backdrop is
    the painted content that lies behind the element. A common filter is a blur allowing designers to construct "frosted glass"
    dialog boxes, video overlays, translucent navigation headers, and more.


    This was initially implemented the same way as a regular blur, but sampling beyond the edges of the element allowed colors
    from the edges to bleed in. The spec was changed to sample pixels outside the backdrop edges by duplicating the pixels
    at the edge. This however, results in extreme flickering of content as it enters the backdrop edge. The latest specification
    change mirrors the backdrop when sampling beyond the edge which allows for a smooth gradual introduction of new colors
    at the edges without overweighting on single lines of color.
