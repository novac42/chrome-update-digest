- title: Cross-document view transitions for same-origin navigations
  content: "Previously you had to rearchitect your website to an SPA to use the View Transitions API. This is no longer the\
    \ case. View transitions are now enabled by default for same-origin navigations. You can create a view transition between\
    \ two different documents that are the same-origin.\n\nTo enable a cross-document view transition, both ends need to opt-in.\
    \ To do this, use the `@view-transition` at-rule and set the `navigation` descriptor to `auto`.\n    \n    \n    @view-transition\
    \ {\n      navigation: auto;\n    }\n    \n\nCross-document view transitions use the same building blocks and principles\
    \ as same-document view transitions. Elements that have a `view-transition-name` applied are captured, and you can customize\
    \ the animations using CSS animations.\n\n[Smooth transitions with the View Transition API](/docs/web-platform/view-transitions)\
