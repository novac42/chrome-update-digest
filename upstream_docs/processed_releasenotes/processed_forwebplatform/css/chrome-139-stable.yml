  content: 'This feature supports the string-based syntax for `font-feature-settings` as defined in CSS Fonts Level 4. Invalid
    or unrecognized feature tags will be ignored per specification. No binary or non-standard forms are supported.


    As OpenType fonts become more widely adopted, this enhancement will improve typographic control, reduce redundancy, and
    support a more scalable, modern approach to web design.

- title: Continue running transitions when switching to initial transition value
  content: 'When the transition related properties change, they are only supposed to affect newly started transitions. This
    means that if you change the transition properties, unless you also change the properties which have active transition
    animations, those transition animations will continue with the previously specified duration and easing.


    Chrome incorrectly canceled transitions when the transition property was set to `none`, even though it doesn''t cancel
    them if you only change the `transition-duration`. This change makes Chrome consistent with Safari and Firefox, allowing
    active transitions to continue running, until their property value changes triggering a new transition update.
