- title: CSS highlight inheritance
  content: 'With CSS highlight inheritance, the CSS highlight pseudo-classes, such as `::selection` and `::highlight`, inherit
    their properties through the pseudo highlight chain, rather than the element chain. The result is a more intuitive model
    for inheritance of properties in highlights.
