- title: Fluent scrollbars
  content: 'This feature modernizes the Chromium scrollbars (both overlay and non-overlay) on Windows and Linux to fit the
    Windows 11 Fluent design language. Non-overlay Fluent scrollbars will be enabled by default in Linux and Windows. This
    change applies to Linux as well because Chromium''s Linux scrollbar design has historically been aligned with what ships
    on Windows. How to expose enabling overlay Fluent scrollbars is still being decided.
