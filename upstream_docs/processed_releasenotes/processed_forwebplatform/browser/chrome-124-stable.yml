- title: Keyboard-focusable scroll containers
  content: 'Improves accessibility by making scroll containers focusable using sequential focus navigation. Prior to this
    change, the tab key doesn''t focus scrollers unless `tabIndex` is explicitly set to 0 or more.


    By making scrollers focusable by default, users who can''t (or don''t want to) use a mouse will be able to focus clipped
    content using a keyboard''s tab and arrow keys. This behavior is enabled only if the scroller does not contain any keyboard
    focusable children.


    This feature will be rolled out slowly starting from Chrome 124, and available to all users by Chrome 125.
