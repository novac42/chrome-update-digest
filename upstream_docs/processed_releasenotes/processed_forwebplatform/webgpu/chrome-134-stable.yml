    and data sharing among groups of invocations. These operations can be used to accelerate applications by reducing memory
    overheads incurred by inter-invocation communication.

- title: Digital Credential API
  content: 'Websites can and do get credentials from mobile wallet apps through a variety of mechanisms today, for example,
    custom URL handlers and QR code scanning. This feature lets sites request identity information from wallets using Android''s
    `IdentityCredential` `CredMan` system. It is extensible to support multiple credential formats (for example, ISO mDoc
    and W3C verifiable credential) and allows multiple wallet apps to be used. Mechanisms are being added to help reduce the
    risk of ecosystem-scale abuse of real-world identity.


    The origin trial starting in Chrome 134 adds support for this API on desktop platform, where Chrome on Desktop will securely
    communicate with the digital wallet on the Android phone to fetch the requested credentials.

- title: Deprecation trial for `SelectParserRelaxation`
  content: 'This is a deprecation trial, which re-enables the old parser behavior for parsing `<select>` tags. Under that
    old behavior, non-supported content is silently discarded and not included in the DOM content underneath the `<select>`.
    This trial can be used in case the new behavior enabled from Chrome 135 breaks a site.

- title: Remove nonstandard `getUserMedia` audio constraints
  content: 'Blink supports a number of nonstandard `goog`-prefixed constraints for `getUserMedia` from some time before constraints
    were properly standardized.


    Usage has gone down significantly to between 0.000001% to 0.0009% (depending on the constraint) and some of them don''t
    even have an effect due to changes in the Chromium audio-capture stack. Soon none of them will have any effect due to
    other upcoming changes.


    We don''t expect any major regressions due to this change. Applications using these constraints will continue to work,
    but will get audio with default settings (as if no constraints were passed). They can opt to migrate to standard constraints.
