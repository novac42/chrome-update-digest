- title: Snap Events
  content: 'Snap Events allow developers to reliably listen for when the _snap target_ of a scroller changes and perform style
    adjustments as desired.


    CSS scroll snap points are often used as a mechanism to create scroll interactive selection components, where selection
    is determined with JavaScript intersection observers and a scroll end guesstimate. By creating built-in events, the invisible
    state will become actionable, at the right time, and always correct.


    This feature adds two JavaScript events: `scrollsnapchange` and `scrollsnapchanging`. The `scrollsnapchange` event lets
    developers know, at the completion of a scroll operation (including snapping), that the element to which a scroller is
    snapped has changed. The `scrollsnapchanging` event gives developers a hint, during a scroll operation, that the user
    agent intends to snap the scroll container to a new snap target based on the scrolling input so far.'
