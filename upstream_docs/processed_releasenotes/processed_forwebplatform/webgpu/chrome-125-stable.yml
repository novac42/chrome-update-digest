- title: Remove "window-placement" alias for permission and permission policy "window-management"
  content: 'Removes the "window-placement" alias for permission and permission policy "window-management". This is part of
    a larger effort to rename the strings by eventually [deprecating and removing "window-placement"](/docs/capabilities/web-apis/window-management#the_window-management_permission).
    The terminology change improves the longevity of the descriptor as the Window Management API evolves over time.

- title: Removal of prefixed HTMLVideoElement Fullscreen properties and methods
  content: "The prefixed `HTMLVideoElement` fullscreen APIs have been deprecated since Chrome 38. They were replaced by `Element.requestFullscreen()`,\
    \ which first shipped un-prefixed in 2018 in Chrome 71.\n\nThe following properties and methods will be removed from HTMLVideoElement:\n\
    \n  * `webkitSupportsFullscreen`\n  * `webkitDisplayingFullscreen`\n  * `webkitEnterFullscreen()`\n  * `webkitExitFullscreen()`\n\
    \  * `webkitEnterFullScreen()` (note the different capitalization of the \"S\" in FullScreen)\n  * `webkitExitFullScreen()`\n\
    \nRegister for the deprecation trial listed in this post, if your site still relies on these and you need more time for\
    \ updating code.\n\n[ChromeStatus.com entry](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5111638103687168)"
