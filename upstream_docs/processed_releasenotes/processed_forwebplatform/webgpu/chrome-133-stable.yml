- title: 'WebGPU: 1-component vertex formats (and unorm8x4-bgra)'
  content: 'Adds additional vertex formats not present in the initial release of WebGPU due to lack of support or old macOS
    versions (which are no longer supported by any browser). The 1-component vertex formats let applications request only
    the necessary data when previously they had to request at least two times more for 8 and 16-bit data types. The unorm8x4-bgra
    format makes it slightly more convenient to load BGRA-encoded vertex colors while keeping the same shader.

- title: Reference Target for Cross-root ARIA
  content: 'Reference Target is a feature to enable using IDREF attributes such as `for` and `aria-labelledby` to refer to
    elements inside a component''s shadow DOM, while maintaining encapsulation of the internal details of the shadow DOM.
    The main goal of this feature is to enable ARIA to work across shadow root boundaries.


    A component can specify an element in its shadow tree to act as its "reference target". When the host component is the
    target of a IDREF like a label''s `for` attribute, the reference target becomes the effective target of the label.


    The shadow root specifies the ID of the target element inside the shadow DOM. This is done either in JavaScript with the
    `referenceTarget` attribute on the `ShadowRoot` object, or in HTML markup using the `shadowrootreferencetarget` attribute
    on the `<template>` element.

    \ date in Chrome 135.\n\n  * Redundancy with `maxInterStageShaderVariables`: This limit already serves a similar purpose,\
    \ controlling the amount of data passed between shader stages.\n  * Minor discrepancies: While there are slight differences\
    \ in how the two limits are calculated, these differences are minor and can be effectively managed within the `maxInterStageShaderVariables`\
    \ limit.\n  * Simplification: Removing `maxInterStageShaderComponents` streamlines the shader interface and reduces complexity\
    \ for developers. Instead of managing two separate limits with subtle differences, they can focus on the more appropriately\
    \ named and comprehensive `maxInterStageShaderVariables`.\n\n[ChromeStatus.com entry](https://chromestatus.com/feature/4853767735083008)"

- title: Remove `<link rel=prefetch>` five-minute rule
  content: 'Previously, when a resource was prefetched using `<link rel=prefetch>`, Chrome ignored its cache semantics (namely
    `max-age` and `no-cache`) for the first use within five minutes, to avoid refetching. Now, Chrome removes this special
    case and uses normal HTTP cache semantics.


    This means web developers need to include appropriate caching headers (Cache-Control or Expires) to see benefits from
    `<link rel=prefetch>`.


    This also affects the nonstandard `<link rel=prerender>`.
