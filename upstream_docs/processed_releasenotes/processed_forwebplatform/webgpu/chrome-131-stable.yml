- title: WebGPU clip distances
  content: 'Adds the optional GPU feature `clip-distances` that allows setting user-defined clip distances in vertex shader
    outputs. This technique is particularly useful for the applications that need to clip all vertices in a scene that are
    beyond a user-defined plane, such as many CAD applications.

    getConfiguration()` method to check the canvas context configuration. It includes GPU `device`, `format`, `usage`, `viewFormats`,
    `colorSpace`, `toneMapping`, and `alphaMode` members. [As discussed in issue 4828](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/4828),
    web apps can use it to detect whether HDR canvas is supported in WebGPU.

- title: 'Private Aggregation API: Increase contribution limit to 100 for Protected Audience callers'
  content: 'Enables Protected Audience script runners to make up to 100 contributions per Private Aggregation report, compared
    to the current limit of 20.


    Private Aggregation limits the number of histogram contributions that can be embedded in a single aggregatable report,
    dropping any additional contributions. Shared Storage callers can work around the limit by invoking another Shared Storage
    operation. However, Protected Audience callers have no persistent storage, so they lose their excess contributions at
    the end of their auction. Note that this change is privacy neutral as the API''s contributions are still limited by the
    same privacy budget.


    Due to padding, each Protected Audience report will have a larger payload, even if it did not need the larger contribution
    limit. We expect that these larger reports will increase the cost of operating the Aggregation Service.
