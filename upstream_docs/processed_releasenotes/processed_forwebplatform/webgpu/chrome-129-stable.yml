  content: 'Adds tone mapping parameters to the WebGPU canvas configuration, and adds options of `standard` (the current behavior
    of restricting content to the SDR range of the display) as the default, and `extended` (not imposing this restriction)
    as a new behavior. This allows WebGPU content to use the full range of a display.

- title: Deprecate 0.0.0.0 for Private Network Access
  content: 'Chrome will block access to IP address `0.0.0.0` in advance of Private Network Access (PNA) completely rolling
    out.


    Chrome is deprecating direct access to private network endpoints from public websites as part of the [PNA specification](/blog/private-network-access-preflight).
    Services listening on localhost (`127.0.0.0/8`) are considered private according to the specification. Chrome''s PNA protection
    can be bypassed using the IP address `0.0.0.0` to access services listening on the localhost on macOS and Linux.


    This can also be abused in DNS rebinding attacks targeting a web application listening on the localhost.


    This release of Chrome removes three features.

- title: Remove the includeShadowRoots argument on DOMParser
  content: "The `includeShadowRoots` argument was a never-standardized argument to the `DOMParser.parseFromString()` function,\
    \ which was there to allow imperative parsing of HTML content that contains declarative shadow DOM. This was shipped in\
    \ Chrome 90 as part of the initial shipment of declarative shadow DOM.\n\nNow that a standardized version of this feature\
    \ is available with the `setHTMLUnsafe()` and `parseHTMLUnsafe()` methods, the non-standard `includeShadowRoots` argument\
    \ will be removed. Code should be updated as follows:\n\nInstead of:\n    \n    \n    ((new DOMParser()).parseFromString(html,'text/html',{includeShadowRoots:\
    \ true});\n    \n\nUse:\n    \n    \n    Document.parseHTMLUnsafe(html);\n    \n\n[Tracking bug #329330085](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/329330085)\

- title: Remove non-standard declarative shadow DOM serialization
  content: 'The prototype implementation of declarative shadow DOM contained a method called `getInnerHTML()` used to serialize
    DOM trees containing shadow roots. That part of the prototype was not standardized with the rest of declarative shadow
    dom, and instead a replacement was designedâ€”`getHTML()`.


    Therefore the old `getInnerHTML()` method is now being removed from Chrome, you should use [`getHTML()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/getHTML)
    as a replacement, which will soon be interoperable across browsers.

- title: Remove PointerEvent.getCoalescedEvents() from insecure contexts
  content: 'The Pointer Events Working Group made `PointerEvent.getCoalescedEvents()` restricted to secure contexts over four
    years ago, which removed the API from insecure contexts. Chrome originally shipped the old behavior and didn''t follow
    the spec change immediately because of compat concerns.


    We are now removing it from insecure contexts because Chrome usage in insecure contexts turned out to be very low.
