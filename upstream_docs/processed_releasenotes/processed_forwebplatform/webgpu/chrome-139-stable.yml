- title: 3D texture support for BC and ASTC compressed formats
  content: "The `\"texture-compression-bc-sliced-3d\"` and `\"texture-compression-astc-sliced-3d\"` WebGPU features add support\
    \ for 3D textures using Block Compression (BC) and Adaptive Scalable Texture Compression (ASTC) formats. This lets you\
    \ take advantage of the efficient compression capabilities of BC and ASTC formats for volumetric texture data, offering\
    \ significant reductions in memory footprint and bandwidth requirements without substantial loss in visual quality. This\
    \ is particularly valuable in fields such as scientific visualization, medical imaging, and advanced rendering techniques.\n\
    \nThe following code snippet checks whether the adapter supports 3D textures with BC and ASTC compressed formats and requests\
    \ a device with these features if they are available.\n    \n    \n    const adapter = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter();\n\
    \    \n    const requiredFeatures = [];\n    if (adapter?.features.has(\"texture-compression-bc-sliced-3d\")) {\n    \
    \  requiredFeatures.push(\n        \"texture-compression-bc\",\n        \"texture-compression-bc-sliced-3d\",\n      );\n\
    \    }\n    if (adapter?.features.has(\"texture-compression-astc-sliced-3d\")) {\n      requiredFeatures.push(\n     \
    \   \"texture-compression-astc\",\n        \"texture-compression-astc-sliced-3d\",\n      );\n    }\n    const device\
    \ = await adapter?.requestDevice({ requiredFeatures });\n    \n    // Later on...\n    if (device.features.has(\"texture-compression-astc-sliced-3d\"\
    )) {\n      // Create a 3D texture using ASTC compression\n    } else if (device.features.has(\"texture-compression-bc-sliced-3d\"\
    )) {\n      // Create a 3D texture using BC compression\n    } else {\n      // Fallback: Create an uncompressed 3D texture\n\

- title: New "core-features-and-limits" feature
  content: 'A new `"core-features-and-limits"` feature is being introduced for the upcoming WebGPU compatibility mode. This
    feature indicates that the adapter or device supports core features and limits of the WebGPU spec. "core" WebGPU is the
    only version available at the moment, so all WebGPU implementations must include `"core-features-and-limits"` in their
    supported features.


    In the future, when WebGPU compatibility mode ships, an adapter or a device may not have this feature to signify it is
    a compatibility mode adapter or device and not a core one. When enabled on a device, this lifts all compatibility mode
    restrictions (features and limits).


    For a detailed explanation and usage in WebGPU compatibility mode, refer to the [explainer](https://gist.github.com/greggman/0dea9995e33393c546a4c2bd2a12e50e)
    and the following section. See [issue 418025721](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/418025721).'

- title: Origin trial for WebGPU compatibility mode
  content: "WebGPU is a powerful API designed for modern graphics, aligning with technologies like Vulkan, Metal, and Direct3D\
    \ 12. However, a significant number of devices still lack support for these newer APIs. For example, on Windows, 31% of\
    \ Chrome users don't have Direct3D 11.1 or higher. On Android, 15% of Android users don't have Vulkan 1.1, including 10%\
    \ who don't have Vulkan at all.\n\nThis creates a challenge for developers who want to maximize their application's reach.\
    \ They're often forced to develop multiple implementations (for example, WebGPU and WebGL), accept a more limited audience\
    \ with core WebGPU, or stick to WebGL, missing out on WebGPU's advanced features like GPU compute.\n\n![Visual representation\
    \ of WebGPU compatibility mode.](/static/blog/new-in-webgpu-139/image/webgpu-compatibility-mode.png) WebGPU compatibility\
    \ mode expanded reach.\n\nWebGPU compatibility mode offers a solution by providing an opt-in, slightly restricted version\
    \ of the WebGPU API. This mode is designed to run older graphics APIs like OpenGL ES 3.1 and Direct3D11, significantly\
    \ expanding your application's reach to devices that don't support modern, explicit graphics APIs required by core WebGPU.\n\
    \nBecause compatibility mode is a subset of WebGPU, applications built with it are also valid WebGPU \"core\" applications.\
    \ This means they will seamlessly run even on browsers that don't specifically support compatibility mode.\n\nFor many\
    \ basic applications, enabling compatibility mode is as straightforward as passing `featureLevel: \"compatibility\"` when\
    \ you call [requestAdapter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/GPU/requestAdapter). More complex applications\
    \ might require [minor adjustments](https://webgpufundamentals.org/webgpu/lessons/webgpu-compatibility-mode.html) to fit\
    \ within the mode's restrictions. The [Generate Mipmap WebGPU sample](https://webgpu.github.io/webgpu-samples/?sample=generateMipmap)\
    \ is a good example.\n    \n    \n    // Request a GPUAdapter in compatibility mode\n    const adapter = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter({\n\
    \      featureLevel: \"compatibility\",\n    });\n    \n    const hasCore = adapter?.features.has(\"core-features-and-limits\"\
    );\n    const device = await adapter?.requestDevice({\n      requiredFeatures: (hasCore ? [\"core-features-and-limits\"\
    ] : []),\n    });\n    \n    if (device?.features.has(\"core-features-and-limits\")) {\n      // Compatibility mode restrictions\
    \ will apply\n    }"
