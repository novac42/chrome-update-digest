- title: SVG `context-fill` and `context-stroke`
  content: 'Implements an existing SVG feature that allows the keywords `context-fill` and `context-stroke` when specifying
    fill and stroke properties. This only affects SVG sub-trees that are instantiated with a `<use>` element, and `<marker>`
    elements that are instantiated using the `marker` property on a `<path>` element. In those circumstances, `context-fill`
    and `context-stroke` are resolved to the value of the `fill` and `stroke` properties on the `<use>` or `<path>`.

- title: 'WebGPU: ServiceWorker and SharedWorker support'
  content: '[ServiceWorker and SharedWorker support](/blog/new-in-webgpu-124#service_workers_and_shared_workers_support) is
    added to WebGPU, aligning with existing WebGL capabilities.


    Service Workers enable offline capabilities and background processing for WebGPU. This means graphics-intensive web applications
    or Chrome Extensions can cache resources and perform computations even when the user isn''t actively interacting with
    the page.


    Shared Workers allow multiple tabs or extension contexts to coordinate and share WebGPU resources. This leads to smoother
    performance and more efficient use of the user''s graphics hardware.

- title: Deprecation trial for mutation events
  content: 'Mutation events, including `DOMSubtreeModified`, `DOMNodeInserted`, `DOMNodeRemoved`, `DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument`,
    `DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument`, and `DOMCharacterDataModified`, can damage page performance, and also significantly increase
    the complexity of adding new features to the Web. These APIs were deprecated from the specification in 2011, and were
    replaced (in 2012) by the much better-behaved Mutation Observer API.


    Mutation event support [will be disabled by default starting in Chrome 127](/blog/mutation-events-deprecation), around
    July 30, 2024. Code should be migrated to the Mutation Observer API before that date to avoid site breakage. If more time
    is needed, register for [Mutation events deprecation trial](/origintrials#/view_trial/919297273937002497) to re-enable
    the feature for a limited time on a given site. This can be used through Chrome 134, ending March 25, 2025.


    Alternatively, a `MutationEventsEnabled` enterprise policy can also be used for the same purpose, also through Chrome
    134.
