- title: Remove support for macOS 11
  content: Chrome 138 is the last release to support macOS 11. From Chrome 139 macOS 11 is not supported, as it is outside
    of its support window with Apple. Running on a supported operating system is essential to maintaining security. On Macs
    running macOS 11, Chrome will continue to work, showing a warning infobar, but will not update any further. If a user
    wishes to update Chrome, they need to update their computer to a supported version of macOS. For new installations of
    Chrome 139 and up, macOS 12 or greater will be required.

- title: Remove auto-detection of ISO-2022-JP charset in HTML
  content: There are [known security issues](https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/encoding-differentials-why-charset-matters/)
    around charset auto-detection for ISO-2022-JP. Given that the usage is very low, and Safari does not support auto-detection
    of ISO-2022-JP, Chrome removes support for it to eliminate the security issues.
