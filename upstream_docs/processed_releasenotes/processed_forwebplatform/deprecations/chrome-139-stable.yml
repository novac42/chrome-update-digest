- title: 'Stop sending Purpose: prefetch header from prefetches and prerenders'
  content: 'Now that prefetches and prerenders are using the `Sec-Purpose` header for prefetches and prerenders, we will move
    to remove the legacy Purpose: prefetch header that is still currently passed. This will be behind a feature flag/ kill
    switch to prevent compat issues.


    This will be scoped to speculation rules prefetch, speculation rules prerender, `<link rel=prefetch>`, and Chrome''s non-standard
    `<link rel=prerender>`.

  content: 'There are [known security issues](https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/encoding-differentials-why-charset-matters/)
