    As OpenType fonts become more widely adopted, this enhancement will improve typographic control, reduce redundancy, and
    support a more scalable, modern approach to web design.

    means that if you change the transition properties, unless you also change the properties which have active transition
    animations, those transition animations will continue with the previously specified duration and easing.


    Chrome incorrectly canceled transitions when the transition property was set to `none`, even though it doesn''t cancel
    them if you only change the `transition-duration`. This change makes Chrome consistent with Safari and Firefox, allowing
    active transitions to continue running, until their property value changes triggering a new transition update.

  content: 'This launch enables TCP port randomization on versions of Windows (2020 or later) where we don''t expect to see
    issues with re-use of prior ports occurring too fast (causing rejection due to timeouts on port re-use). The rapid port
    re-use issue arises from the Birthday problem, where the probability of randomly re-picking a port already seen rapidly
    converges with 100% for each new port chosen when compared to port re-use in a sequential model.

- title: Remove auto-detection of `ISO-2022-JP` charset in HTML
  content: 'There are [known security issues](https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/encoding-differentials-why-charset-matters/)
    around charset auto-detection for `ISO-2022-JP`. Given that the usage is very low, and Safari does not support auto-detection
    of `ISO-2022-JP`, support is removed from Chrome 139.
