- Blob URL Partitioning: Fetching/NavigationAs a continuation of Storage Partitioning, Chrome 137 now implements partitioning of Blob URL access by Storage Key (top-level site, frame origin, and the has-cross-site-ancestor boolean), with the exception of top-level navigations which will remain partitioned only by frame origin. This behavior is similar to what’s currently implemented by both Firefox and Safari, and aligns Blob URL usage with the partitioning scheme used by other storage APIs as part of Storage Partitioning. In addition, Chrome 137 now enforces noopener on renderer-initiated top-level navigations to Blob URLs where the corresponding site is cross-site to the top-level site performing the navigation. This aligns Chrome with similar behavior in Safari, and the relevant specs have been updated to reflect these changes.This change can be temporarily reverted by setting thePartitionedBlobURLUsagepolicy. The policy will be deprecated when the other storage partitioning related enterprise policies are deprecated.Chrome 137on Android, ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, Windows

- Client’s LLM assistance in mitigating scamsUsers on the web are facing significant amounts of different kinds of scams a day. To combat these scams, Chrome now leverages on-device LLM to identify scam websites for Enhanced Safe Browsing users. Chrome sends the page content to an on-device LLM to infer security-related signals of the page and send these signals to Safe Browsing server side for a final verdict. When enabled, Chrome might consume more bandwidth to download the LLM.Enhanced Safe Browsing is an existing feature, controlled by theSafeBrowsingProtectionLevelpolicy.Chrome 134 on Linux, macOS, Windows: Gather the brand name and intent summary of the page that triggers keyboard lock to identify scam websites.Chrome 135 on Linux, macOS, Windows: Show the warnings to the user based on the server verdict which uses the brand and intent summary of the page that triggered keyboard lock.Chrome 137 on Linux, macOS, Windows:Gather brand and intent summary of the page based on server reputation scoring system.Chrome 138 on Linux, macOS, Windows: Show the warnings to the user based on the server verdict which uses the brand and intent of the pages that the server reputation system scored.

- Remove --load-extension command line switch in Google ChromeTo enhance the security and stability of the Chrome browser for our users, official Chrome-branded builds now deprecate the ability to load extensions via the--load-extensioncommand-line flag, starting in Chrome 137.

- Remove SwiftShader fallbackAllowing automatic fallback toWebGLbacked bySwiftShaderis deprecated and WebGL context creation now fails instead of falling back to SwiftShader.This was done for two primary reasons:SwiftShader is a high security risk due to JIT-ed code running in Chromium's GPU process.Users have a poor experience when falling back from a high-performance GPU-backed WebGL to a CPU-backed implementation. Users have no control over this behavior and it is difficult to describe in bug reports.SwiftShader is a useful tool for web developers to test their sites on systems that are headless or do not have a supported GPU. This use case will still be supported by opting in but is not intended for running untrusted content. To opt in to lower security guarantees and allow SwiftShader for WebGL, run the chrome executable with the--enable-unsafe-swiftshadercommand-line switch.During the deprecation period, a warning will appear in the JavaScript console when a WebGL context is created and backed with SwiftShader. Passing--enable-unsafe-swiftshaderwill remove this warning message.Chromium and other browsers do not guarantee WebGL availability. It is important to test and handle WebGL context creation failure and fall back to other web APIs such as Canvas2D or an appropriate message to the user. A temporary enterprise policy will be available in Chrome 138 to revert the change.Chrome 137 on Windows:SwiftShader will be disabled and replaced with another software WebGL fallback, WARP. Tests depending on the exact pixel values generated by SwiftShader may start failing.Chrome 138 on Linux, macOS:Swiftshader will be disabled on macOS and Linux as early as Chrome 138. Users on machines without a GPU will not be able to use WebGL.

- Customizing managed profiles with custom logo and labelChrome 137 has a new toolbar and profile menu customizations that help users easily identify if their Chrome profile is managed, whether they're on a work or personal device. This is especially useful for BYOD scenarios where employees use their own devices with managed accounts.To help tailor this experience, we're adding three new policies:-EnterpriseCustomLabel: Customize the text displayed on the toolbar element to match your organization's branding.-EnterpriseLogoUrl: Add your company logo to the profile menu.-EnterpriseProfileBadgeToolbarSettings: This policy can disable the default label for a managed profile in the Chrome toolbar.In Chrome 134, these policies became available to customize the logo and label shown on a managed profile. Starting Chrome 137, there are updates to the default behavior of the profile label and icon overlaid on the account avatar.

- Align error type thrown forpaymentWebAuthn credential creation: SecurityError => NotAllowedErrorThis change corrects the error type thrown during WebAuthn credential creation forpaymentcredentials. Due to a historic specification mismatch, creating apaymentcredential in a cross-origin iframe without a user activation would throw aSecurityErrorinstead of aNotAllowedError, which is what is thrown for non-payment credentials.Code that previously detected the type of error thrown, for example,  `e instanceof SecurityError`, would be affected. Code that just generally handles errors during credential creation, for example,  `catch (e)`, will continue to function correctly.Chrome 137 on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android

- DLP download support for File System Access API (FSA)Chrome Enterprise Premium's Data Loss Prevention (DLP) content analysis and Safe Browse deep scans now extend to folder and directory downloads initiated via theFile System Access (FSA) API, for example, in web-based IDEs. This addresses a gap, enhancing data security by applying existing DLP rules (configured viaDataLeakPreventionRulesListandSafeBrowsingDeepScanningEnabledpolicies) to these operations.If a download violates a DLP policy, it will be blocked, resulting in an empty file, and the website might indicate aBlocked by Safe Browseerror. This change primarily benefits security by preventing data exfiltration through this vector. Administrators should test this with web applications using the FSA API to observe the behavior with their current DLP configurations.Chrome 137 on ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, Windows:Enables DLP content analysis for downloads initiated via File System Access API on selected platforms, governed by existing enterprise policies.

- Bookmarks and reading list improvements on Chrome DesktopOn Chrome 138 on Desktop, some users who sign in to Chrome upon saving a new bookmark can now use and save bookmarks and reading list items in their Google Account. Relevant enterprise policies controlling bookmarks, as well asBrowserSignin,SyncDisabledorSyncTypesListDisabled, will continue to work as before, so admins can configure whether users can use and save items in their Google Account. SettingEditBookmarksEnabledto false will also prevent users from uploading a bookmark saved on their device to their Google Account.Chrome 138 on Linux, macOS, Windows

- Per-extension user script toggleIn Chrome 138, the way that users and administrators control an extension’s ability to run user created scripts and use theuserScripts APIis changing. This change enhances security. End-users won’t unintentionally grant user script permissions to every extension when enablingDeveloper modeby explicitly deciding which extensions can run these potentially powerful scripts. For more detail on the motivation for the change, see thisChrome for developersblog.End users will now toggle this per extension on thechrome://extensionspage via aAllow User Scriptstoggle, replacing the globalDeveloper modetoggle for more granular control. Existing extensions will have this toggle automatically enabled ifDeveloper modeis on and the extension has been granted the User Scripts permission.Administrators who currently manage user scripts by disabling developer mode should now use the`blocked_permissions` policyor theGoogle Admin consoleto independently control the User Scripts permission and extensionDeveloper mode.Extension developers are advised to update their documentation to reflect the new toggle.

- Removal of Private Network Access enterprise policiesPrivate Network Access (PNA 1.0) is an unshipped security feature designed to limit website access to local networks. Due to deployability concerns, PNA 1.0 was never able to ship by default, as it was incompatible with too many existing devices.PNA 1.0 required changes to devices on local networks. Instead, Chrome is implementing an updated proposal, Private Network Access 2.0 (PNA 2.0) (Github). PNA 2.0 only requires changes to sites that need to access the local network, rather than requiring changes to devices on the local network. Sites are much easier to update than devices, and so this approach should be much more straightforward to roll out.The only way to enforce PNA 1.0 is via enterprise policy. To avoid regressing security for enterprise customers opting-in to PNA 1.0 prior to shipping PNA 2.0, we will maintain thePrivateNetworkAccessRestrictionsEnabledpolicy, which causes Chrome to send special preflight messages, until such time that it becomes incompatible with PNA 2.0.TheInsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedForUrlsandInsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedpolicies, which loosen PNA 1.0 restrictions, will be removed immediately. These policies currently have no effect, since PNA 1.0 is not shipped, and they will have no meaning once PNA 1.0 is removed.Chrome 135 on Android, ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Fuchsia: DeprecateInsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedForUrls,InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowed, andPrivateNetworkAccessRestrictionsEnabledpolicies.Chrome 138 on Android, ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Fuchsia:Removal ofPrivateNetworkAccessRestrictionsEnabled,InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedForUrlsandInsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowed.

The feature is expected to demonstrate performance improvements and will be available in Chrome 138 with a policy (TLS13EarlyDataEnabled) to control this change.TLS 1.3 Early Data is an established protocol. Existing TLS servers, middleboxes, and security software are expected to either handle or reject TLS 1.3 Early Data without dropping the connection.

- Predictable reported storage quotaChrome 138 will introduce a predictable storage quota from StorageManager's estimate API for sites that do not have unlimited storage permissions.It is possible to detect a user's browsing mode via the reported storage quota because the storage space made available is significantly smaller in incognito mode than in regular mode. This is a mitigation that prevents detection of a user's browsing mode via the storage API by reporting an artificial quota, equal to usage + min(10 GiB, disk rounded up to the nearest 1 GiB), in all browsing modes for sites with limited storage permissions. Sites with unlimited storage permissions will be unaffected. Enforced quota will also be unaffected.Chrome 138 on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android

- Migrate extensions to Manifest V3 before June 2025Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3. Chrome extensions are transitioning to a new manifest version, Manifest V3. This will bring improved privacy for your users—for example, by moving to a model where extensions modify requests declaratively, without the ability to see individual requests. This also improves extension security, as remotely hosted code will be disallowed on Manifest V3.Beginning June 2024, Chrome will gradually disable Manifest V2 extensions running in the browser. An Enterprise policy -ExtensionManifestV2Availability- can be used to test Manifest V3 in your organization ahead of the migration. Additionally, machines on which the policy is enabled will not be subject to the disabling of Manifest V2 extensions until the following year - June 2025 - at which point the policy will be removed.You can see which Manifest version is being used by all Chrome extensions running on your fleet using the Apps & extensions usage page in Chrome Enterprise Core.Chrome 127 on ChromeOS, LaCrOS, Linux, macOS, Windows: Chrome will gradually disable Manifest V2 extensions on user devices.

If a user wishes to have their Chrome updated, they need to update their computer to a supported version of macOS. For new installations of Chrome 139 and later, macOS 12 or later will be required.

- Isolated Web AppsIsolated Web Apps (IWAs) are an extension of existing work on PWA installation and Web Packaging that provide stronger protections against server compromise and other tampering that is necessary for developers of security-sensitive applications.Rather than being hosted on live web servers and fetched over HTTPS, these applications are packaged into Web Bundles, signed by their developer, and distributed to end-users through one or more of the potential methods described in theexplainer.In this initial release, IWAs will only be installable through an admin policy on enterprise-managed ChromeOS devices.Chrome 140 on Windows:This rollout adds support for Isolated Web Apps in enterprise-managed browser configurations on Windows.

- Disallow spaces in non-file:// URL hostsAccording to theURL Standard specification, URL hosts cannot contain the space character, but currently URL parsing in Chromium allows spaces in the host. This causes Chromium to fail several tests included in theInterop2024 HTTPS URLs for WebSocketandURL focusareas. To bring Chromium into spec compliance, we would like to remove spaces from URL hosts altogether, but a difficulty with this is that they are used in the host part in Windows file:// URLs (Github).Chrome 141 on Android, ChromeOS, LaCrOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Fuchsia

- UI Automation accessibility framework provider on WindowsStarting in Chrome 126, Chrome will start directly supporting accessibility client software that uses Microsoft Windows's UI Automation accessibility framework. Prior to this change, such software interoperated with Chrome by way of a compatibility shim in Microsoft Windows. This change is being made to improve the accessible user experience for many users. It provides complete support for Narrator, Magnifier, and Voice Access; and will improve third-party apps that use Windows's UI Automation accessibility framework. Users of Chrome will find reduced memory usage and processing overhead when used with accessibility tools. It will also ease development of software using assistive technologies.Administrators may use theUiAutomationProviderEnabledenterprise policy starting in Chrome 125 to either force-enable the new provider (so that all users receive the new functionality), or disable the new provider. This policy will be supported through Chrome 146, and will be removed in Chrome 147.

- Inactive profile deletion in Chrome Enterprise CoreIn June 2025, the inactive period for profile deletion setting started to roll out. In July 2025, the setting will begin to automatically delete managed profiles in the Admin console that have been inactive for more than the defined inactivity period. When releasing the setting, the inactivity period of time has a default value of 90 days. Meaning that by default, all managed profiles that have been inactive for more than 90 days are deleted from your account. Administrators can change the inactive period value using this setting. The maximum value to determine the profile inactivity period is 730 days and the minimum value is 28 days.If you lower the set value, it might have a global impact on any currently managed profiles. All impacted profiles will be considered inactive and, therefore, be deleted. This does not delete the user account. If an inactive profile is re-activated on a device, that profile will reappear in the console.Chrome 138 on Android, ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, Windows:Policy will roll out in June.

- Custom data directory required for remote debuggingRemote debugging via a TCP port or a pipe is no longer possible in Google Chrome with the default data directory on Windows, Linux, and macOS. A custom data directory must be specified to remotely debug Google Chrome using the--user-data-dirswitch, when using the--remote-debugging-pipeor--remote-debugging-portswitches.We’ve made this change because these remote debugging switches are being abused by infostealers and malware to extract data from Google Chrome. A custom user data directory uses a different encryption key and so it prevents malware stealing encrypted data such as cookies.This change does not affect Chrome for Testing and Chromium.Chrome 136 on Linux, macOS, Windows

- Partitioning:visitedlinks historyTo eliminate user browsing history leaks, anchor elements are styled as:visitedonly if they have been clicked from this top-level site and frame origin before. On the browser-side, this means that the VisitedLinks hashtable is now partitioned by triple-keying, that is, by storing the following for each visited link: <link URL, top-level site, frame origin>. By only styling links that have been clicked on this site and frame before, the many side-channel attacks that have been developed to obtain:visitedlinks styling information are now obsolete, as they no longer provide sites with new information about users.There is an exception forself-links, where links to a site's own pages can be styled as:visitedeven if they have not been clicked on in this exact top-level site and frame origin before. This exemption is only enabled in top-level frames or subframes which are same-origin with the top-level frame. The privacy benefits above are still achieved because sites already know which of its subpages a user has visited, so no new information is exposed. This was a community-requested exception which improves user experience as well.Chrome 136 on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android

- Rename attr() typestringkeyword toraw-stringTheattr()type argument specifies how the attribute value is parsed into a CSS value. In a recent decision by theW3C CSS Working Group, it was resolved to rename theattr()typestringkeyword to the more explicitraw-string. If the attribute value is given as theraw-stringkeyword, or omitted entirely, it causes the attribute’s literal value to be treated as the value of a CSS string, with no CSS parsing performed at all (including CSS escapes, whitespace removal, comments, etc).

- Removal of Private Network Access enterprise policiesPrivate Network Access (PNA 1.0) is an unshipped security feature designed to limit website access to local networks. Due to deployability concerns, PNA 1.0 was never able to ship by default, as it was incompatible with too many existing devices.PNA 1.0 required changes to devices on local networks. Instead, Chrome is implementing an updated proposal, Private Network Access 2.0 (PNA 2.0). PNA 2.0 (Github) only requires changes to sites that need to access the local network, rather than requiring changes to devices on the local network. Sites are much easier to update than devices, and so this approach should be much more straightforward to roll out.The only way to enforce PNA 1.0 is via enterprise policy. To avoid regressing security for enterprise customers opting-in to PNA 1.0 prior to shipping PNA 2.0, we will maintain thePrivateNetworkAccessRestrictionsEnabledpolicy, which causes Chrome to send special preflight messages, until such time that it becomes incompatible with PNA 2.0.TheInsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedForUrlsandInsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedpolicies, which loosen PNA 1.0 restrictions, will be removed immediately. These policies currently have no effect, since PNA 1.0 is not shipped, and they will have no meaning once PNA 1.0 is removed.Chrome 135 on Android, ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Fuchsia: Removal ofInsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedForUrlsandInsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedpolicies.Chrome 137 on Android, ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Fuchsia:Removal ofPrivateNetworkAccessRestrictionsEnabled.

- Remove SwiftShader fallbackAllowing automatic fallback toWebGLbacked bySwiftShaderis deprecated and WebGL context creation will fail instead of falling back to SwiftShader. This was done for two primary reasons:SwiftShader is a high security risk due to JIT-ed code running in Chromium's GPU process.Users have a poor experience when falling back from a high-performance GPU-backed WebGL to a CPU-backed implementation. Users have no control over this behavior and it is difficult to describe in bug reports.SwiftShader is a useful tool for web developers to test their sites on systems that are headless or do not have a supported GPU. This use case will still be supported by opting in but is not intended for running untrusted content. To opt in to lower security guarantees and allow SwiftShader for WebGL, run the chrome executable with the--enable-unsafe-swiftshadercommand-line switch.During the deprecation period, a warning will appear in the javascript console when a WebGL context is created and backed with SwiftShader. Passing--enable-unsafe-swiftshaderwill remove this warning message.Chromium and other browsers do not guarantee WebGL availability. It is important to test and handle WebGL context creation failure and fall back to other web APIs such as Canvas2D or an appropriate message to the user. A temporary enterprise policy will be available to revert the change.Chrome 137 on Linux, macOS:Swiftshader will be disabled on macOS and Linux as early as Chrome 137. Users on machines without a GPU will not be able to use WebGL.Chrome 137 on Windows:SwiftShader will be disabled and replaced with another software WebGL fallback, WARP. Tests depending on the exact pixel values generated by SwiftShader may start failing.

- Align error type thrown forpaymentWebAuthn credential creation: SecurityError => NotAllowedErrorThis change corrects the error type thrown during WebAuthn credential creation for payment credentials. Due to a historic specification mismatch, creating a payment credential in a cross-origin iframe without a user activation would throw aSecurityErrorinstead of aNotAllowedError, which is what is thrown for non-payment credentials. Code that previously detected the type of error thrown, for example,e instanceof SecurityError, would be affected. Code that just generally handles errors during credential creation, for example,catch (e), will continue to function correctly.Chrome 137 on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android

- Blob URL Partitioning: Fetching/NavigationAs a continuation of Storage Partitioning, Chromium will implement partitioning of Blob URL access by Storage Key (top-level site, frame origin, and thehas-cross-site-ancestorboolean), with the exception of top-level navigations which will remain partitioned only by frame origin. This behavior is similar to what’s currently implemented by both Firefox and Safari, and aligns Blob URL usage with the partitioning scheme used by other storage APIs as part of Storage Partitioning. In addition, Chromium will enforce noopener on renderer-initiated top-level navigations to Blob URLs where the corresponding site is cross-site to the top-level site performing the navigation. This aligns Chromium with similar behavior in Safari, and the relevant specs have been updated to reflect these changes.This change can be temporarily reverted by setting thePartitionedBlobURLUsagepolicy. The policy will be deprecated when the other storage partitioning related enterprise policies are deprecated.Chrome 137 on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android

- Migrate extensions to Manifest V3 before June 2025Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3. Chrome extensions are transitioning to a new manifest version, Manifest V3. This will bring improved privacy for your users—for example, by moving to a model where extensions modify requests declaratively, without the ability to see individual requests. This also improves extension security, as remotely hosted code will be disallowed on Manifest V3.Beginning June 2024, Chrome will gradually disable Manifest V2 extensions running in the browser. An enterprise policy,ExtensionManifestV2Availability, can be used to test Manifest V3 in your organization ahead of the migration. Additionally, machines on which the policy is enabled will not be subject to the disabling of Manifest V2 extensions until the following year - June 2025 - at which point the policy will be removed.You can see which Manifest version is being used by all Chrome extensions running on your fleet using theApps & extensions usagepage in Chrome Enterprise Core.Chrome 127 on ChromeOS, LaCrOS, Linux,  macOS, Windows: Chrome will gradually disable Manifest V2 extensions on user devices.

- Disallow spaces in non-file:// URL hostsAccording to theURL Standard specification, URL hosts cannot contain the space character, but currently URL parsing in Chromium allows spaces in the host. This causes Chromium to fail several tests included in theInterop2024 HTTPS URLs for WebSocketandURL focusareas. To bring Chromium into spec compliance, we would like to remove spaces from URL hosts altogether, but a difficulty with this is that they are used in the host part in Windows file:// URLs (Github).Thus this status entry tracks the work to bring Chromium closer to spec compliance by forbidding spaces for non-file URLs only.Chrome 141 on Android, ChromeOS, LaCrOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Fuchsia

- UI Automation accessibility framework provider on WindowsStarting in Chrome 126, Chrome will start directly supporting accessibility client software that uses Microsoft Windows's UI Automation accessibility framework. Prior to this change, such software interoperated with Chrome by way of a compatibility shim in Microsoft Windows. This change is being made to improve the accessible user experience for many users. It provides complete support for Narrator, Magnifier, and Voice Access; and will improve third-party apps that use Windows's UI Automation accessibility framework.

- Inactive profile deletion in Chrome Enterprise CoreIn April 2025, the inactive period for profile deletion policy starts rolling out. In June 2025 (Chrome 138), the policy will begin to automatically delete managed profiles in the Admin console that have been inactive for more than the defined inactivity period. When releasing the policy, the inactivity period of time has a default value of 90 days. Meaning that by default, all managed profiles that have been inactive for more than 90 days are deleted from your account. Administrators can change the inactive period value using this policy. The maximum value to determine the profile inactivity period is 730 days and the minimum value is 28 days.If you lower the set policy value, it might have a global impact on any currently managed profiles. All impacted profiles will be considered inactive and, therefore, be deleted. This does not delete the user account. If an inactive profile is reactivated on a device, that profile will reappear in the console.Chrome 138 on Android, ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, Windows:Policy will roll out in April.

- Multiple identity support on iOSChrome on iOS is introducing support for multiple accounts, particularly for managed (work/school) accounts. This update introduces separate browser profiles for each managed account, ensuring strict data separation between work and personal browsing. Regular accounts will continue to share a single profile. This change aims to improve Chrome's enterprise offering and provide a more secure and organized browsing experience, especially for end users with both personal and work accounts on their device.

Multiple identity support on iOS


Chrome on iOS is introducing support for multiple accounts, particularly for managed (work/school) accounts. This update introduces separate browser profiles for each managed account, ensuring strict data separation between work and personal browsing. Regular accounts will continue to share a single profile. This change aims to improve Chrome's enterprise offering and provide a more secure and organized browsing experience, especially for end users with both personal and work accounts on their device. Users will experience a one-time onboarding flow when adding a managed account to the device. They will be able to switch between accounts by tapping on the account particle disk on theNew tabpage.


Admins can continue to use the following existing policies to manage iOS accounts:

- Quick Share enhancementsAs early as ChromeOS 136, Quick Share extendsVisible to everyonemode duration to a maximum of 10 minutes from 5. This feature allows your device to share files with and receive files from Android devices and other Chromebooks. Users can set device visibility, enterVisible to everyonemode, toggle Quick Share, and go to the Quick Share settings page, all from quick settings. This setting can be managed with theNearbyShareAllowedpolicy.

- Admin initiated Chrome Remote Desktop (CRD) sessionsStarting in ChromeOS 136, auto-approved Chrome Remote Desktop (CRD) connections allow IT teams to better support their ChromeOS users.In previous releases, users had to manually accept remote CRD connections via a notification to allow for remote connections. The new feature automatically accepts remote connections after 30 seconds (if the user does not decline) while ensuring user privacy through a combination of measures, for example, requirement of connection to managed network and end user activity in the last 5 minutes. Auto-accepted CRD connections are expected to significantly streamline support workflows by removing the need for additional end user intervention.

- Client’s LLM assistance in mitigating scamsUsers on the web are facing significant amounts and varieties of scams on a daily basis. To combat these scams, Chrome 135 uses on-device Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify scam websites forEnhanced protectionusers. Chrome sends the page content to an on-device LLM to infer security-related signals for that page. Chrome then sends these signals to Safe Browsing server side for a final verdict. When turned on, Chrome might consume more bandwidth to download the LLM.Chrome 134 on Linux, macOS, WindowsGather the brand name and intent summary of the page that requested keyboard lock API to identify scam websites.Chrome 135 on Linux, macOS, WindowsShow the warnings to the user based on the server verdict which uses the brand and intent summary of the page that requested keyboard lock API.

- Deprecate mutation eventsSynchronous mutation events, includingDOMSubtreeModified,DOMNodeInserted,DOMNodeRemoved,DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument,DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument, andDOMCharacterDataModified, negatively affect page performance, and also significantly increase the complexity of adding new features to the Web. These APIs were deprecated from the spec in 2011, and were replaced (in 2012) by the much better-behaved Mutation Observer API. Usage of the obsolete mutation events must be removed or migrated to Mutation Observer.Since Chrome 124, a temporary enterprise policy,MutationEventsEnabled, is available to re-enable deprecated or removed mutation events. To read more, see thisChrome for Developersblog post. If you encounter any issues, you can file aChromium bug.Mutation event support is disabled by default, since Chrome 127, or around July 30, 2024. Code should have been migrated before that date to avoid site breakage. If more time is needed, there are a few options:TheMutation Events Deprecation Trialcan be used to re-enable the feature for a limited time on a given site.

- Remove Private Network Access enterprise policiesPrivate Network Access (PNA 1.0) is an unshipped security feature designed to limit website access to local networks. Due to deployability concerns, PNA 1.0 was never able to ship by default, as it was incompatible with too many existing devices.PNA 1.0 required changes to devices on local networks. Instead, Chrome is implementing an updated proposal, Private Network Access 2.0 (PNA 2.0). PNA 2.0 only requires changes to sites that need to access the local network, rather than requiring changes to devices on the local network. Sites are much easier to update than devices, and so this approach should be much more straightforward to roll out.The only way to enforce PNA 1.0 is via enterprise policy. To avoid regressing security for enterprise customers opting-in to PNA 1.0 prior to shipping PNA 2.0, we will maintain thePrivateNetworkAccessRestrictionsEnabledpolicy, which causes Chrome to send special preflight messages, until such time that it becomes incompatible with PNA 2.0.Chrome 135 removes theInsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedForUrlsandInsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedpolicies, which loosen PNA 1.0 restrictions. These policies currently have no effect, since PNA 1.0 is not shipped, and they will have no meaning once PNA 1.0 is removed.PNA 2.0 is described in thisexplainer on GitHub.Chrome 135 on Android, ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, FuchsiaRemoval ofInsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedForUrlsandInsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedpolicies.Chrome 137 on Android, ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, FuchsiaRemoval ofPrivateNetworkAccessRestrictionsEnabled.

- HSTS tracking preventionHTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)allows sites to declare themselves accessible through secure connections only.In Chrome 135, HSTS tracking prevention mitigates user tracking by third-parties using the HSTS cache. It only allows HSTS upgrades for top-level navigations and blocks HSTS upgrades for sub-resource requests. This prevents third-party sites using the HSTS cache to track users across the web.

- Remote debugging port custom data directory requirementRemote debugging via a TCP port or a pipe will no longer be possible in Google Chrome with the default data directory on Windows, Linux and macOS.A custom data directory must be specified to remotely debug Google Chrome using the--user-data-dirswitch, when using the--remote-debugging-pipeor--remote-debugging-portswitches.The motivation for this change is because these remote debugging switches are being abused by infostealers and malware to extract data from Google Chrome. A custom user data directory uses a different encryption key and so it becomes no longer possible for malware to steal encrypted data such as cookies.This change does not affect Chrome for Testing and Chromium.Chrome 136 on Linux, macOS, Windows

- Blob URL Partitioning: Fetching/NavigationAs a continuation of Storage Partitioning, Chromium will implement partitioning ofBlob URLaccess by Storage Key (top-level site, frame origin, and the has-cross-site-ancestor boolean), with the exception of top-level navigations which will remain partitioned only by frame origin. This behavior is similar to what’s currently implemented by both Firefox and Safari, and aligns Blob URL usage with the partitioning scheme used by other storage APIs as part of Storage Partitioning. In addition, Chromium will enforce noopener on renderer-initiated top-level navigations to Blob URLs where the corresponding site is cross-site to the top-level site performing the navigation. This aligns Chromium with similar behavior in Safari, and the relevant specs have been updated to reflect these changes.This change can be temporarily reverted by setting thePartitionedBlobURLUsagepolicy. The policy will be deprecated when the other storage partitioning related enterprise policies are deprecated.Chrome 136 on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android

- Partitioning :visited links historyTo eliminate user browsing history leaks, anchor elements are styled as:visitedonly if they have been clicked from this top-level site and frame origin before. On the browser-side, this means that the VisitedLinks hashtable is now partitioned by triple-keying, or by storing the following for each visited link: <link URL, top-level site, frame origin>. By only styling links that have been clicked on this site and frame before, the many side-channel attacks that have been developed to obtain:visitedlinks styling information are now obsolete, as they no longer provide sites with new information about users.There is an exception forself-links, where links to a site's own pages can be styled as:visitedeven if they have not been clicked on in this exact top-level site and frame origin before. This exemption is only enabled in top-level frames or subframes, which are same-origin with the top-level frame. The privacy benefits above are still achieved because sites already know which of its subpages a user has visited, so no new information is exposed. This was a community-requested exception that improves user experience as well.Chrome 136 on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android

- Remove SwiftShader fallbackAs early as Chrome 137, we plan to deprecate automatic fallback to WebGL backed by SwiftShader. WebGL context creation will fail instead of falling back to SwiftShader. We plan to remove SwiftShader fallback for two primary reasons:SwiftShader is a high security risk due to JIT-ed code running in Chromium's GPU process.Users have a poor experience when falling back from a high-performance GPU-backed WebGL to a CPU-backed implementation. Users have no control over this behavior and it is difficult to describe in bug reports.SwiftShaderis a useful tool for web developers to test their sites on systems that are headless or do not have a supported GPU. This use case will still be supported by opting in but is not intended for running untrusted content.To opt in to lower security guarantees and allow SwiftShader for WebGL, run the chrome executable with the--enable-unsafe-swiftshadercommand-line switch.During the deprecation period, a warning will appear in the JavaScript console when a WebGL context is created and backed with SwiftShader. Passing--enable-unsafe-swiftshaderwill remove this warning message.Chromium and other browsers do not guarantee WebGL availability. You can test and handle WebGL context creation failure and fall back to other web APIs such as Canvas2D or an appropriate message to the user.Chrome 137 on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android

- UI Automation accessibility framework provider on WindowsStarting in Chrome 126, Chrome started directly supporting accessibility client software that uses Microsoft Windows's UI Automation accessibility framework. Prior to this change, such software interoperated with Chrome by way of a compatibility shim in Microsoft Windows. This change is being made to improve the accessible user experience for many users. It provides complete support for Narrator, Magnifier, and Voice Access; and will improve third-party apps that use Windows's UI Automation accessibility framework. Users of Chrome will find reduced memory usage and processing overhead when used with accessibility tools. It will also ease development of software using assistive technologies.Admins might use theUiAutomationProviderEnabledenterprise policy, available from Chrome 125, to either force-enable the new provider (so that all users receive the new functionality), or disable the new provider. This policy will be supported through Chrome 136, and will be removed in Chrome 137.

- Inactive profile deletion in Chrome Enterprise CoreIn April 2025 (Chrome 136), the inactive period for profile deletion policy will start rolling out. In June 2025 (Chrome 138), the policy will begin to automatically delete managed profiles in the Admin console that have been inactive for more than the defined inactivity period. When releasing the policy, the inactivity period of time has a default value of 90 days. Meaning that by default, all managed profiles that have been inactive for more than 90 days are deleted from your account. Administrators can change the inactive period value using this policy. The maximum value to determine the profile inactivity period is 730 days and the minimum value is 28 days.If you lower the set policy value, it might have a global impact on any currently managed profiles. All impacted profiles will be considered inactive and, therefore, be deleted. This does not delete the user account. If an inactive profile is re-activated on a device, that profile will reappear in the console.Chrome 138 on Android, ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, WindowsPolicy will roll out in April (Chrome 136). Deletion will start in June (Chrome 138) and the initial wave of deletion will complete by the end of July (Chrome 139). After the initial deletion rollout, inactive profiles will continue to be deleted once they have reached their inactivity period.

New toolbar and profile menu customizations that help users easily identify if their Chrome profile is managed, whether they're on a work or personal device. This is especially useful for scenarios where employees use their own devices with managed accounts.


To help tailor this experience, we're adding three new policies:


- EnterpriseCustomLabel:Customize the text displayed on the toolbar element to match your organization's branding.
- EnterpriseLogoUrl: Add your company logo to the profile menu.
- EnterpriseProfileBadgeToolbarSettings: This policy can disable the default label for a managed profile in the Chrome toolbar.


In Chrome 134, these policies will be available to customize the logo and label shown on a managed profile. The policies will take effect on user’s managed profiles.


Starting Chrome 135, there will be updates to the default behavior of the profile label and icon overlaid on the account avatar. Managed profiles will show aworkorschoollabel in addition to the profile disk. In the profile menu, there will be a building icon overlaid on the account avatar. The expanded profile disk can be disabled viaEnterpriseProfileBadgeToolbarSettings.

- Removal of Private Network Access enterprise policiesPrivate Network Access (PNA 1.0) is an unshipped security feature designed to limit website access to local networks. Due to deployability concerns, PNA 1.0 was never able to ship by default, as it was incompatible with too many existing devices.PNA 1.0 required changes to devices on local networks. Instead, Chrome is implementing an updated proposal, Private Network Access 2.0 (PNA 2.0). PNA 2.0 only requires changes to sites that need to access the local network, rather than requiring changes to devices on the local network. Sites are much easier to update than devices, and so this approach should be much more straightforward to roll out.The only way to enforce PNA 1.0 is via enterprise policy. To avoid regressing security for enterprise customers opting-in to PNA 1.0 prior to shipping PNA 2.0, we will maintain thePrivateNetworkAccessRestrictionsEnabledpolicy, which causes Chrome to send special preflight messages, until such time that it becomes incompatible with PNA 2.0.TheInsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedForUrlsandInsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedpolicies, which loosen PNA 1.0 restrictions, will be removed in Chrome 135.

- Blob URL Partitioning: Fetching/NavigationAs a continuation of Storage Partitioning, Chromium will implement partitioning ofBlob URLaccess by Storage Key (top-level site, frame origin, and the has-cross-site-ancestor boolean), with the exception of top-level navigations which will remain partitioned only by frame origin. This behavior is similar to what’s currently implemented by both Firefox and Safari, and aligns Blob URL usage with the partitioning scheme used by other storage APIs as part of Storage Partitioning. In addition, Chromium will enforce noopener on renderer-initiated top-level navigations to Blob URLs where the corresponding site is cross-site to the top-level site performing the navigation. This aligns Chromium with similar behavior in Safari, and the relevant specs have been updated to reflect these changes.This change can be temporarily reverted by setting thePartitionedBlobURLUsagepolicy. The policy will be deprecated when the other storage partitioning related enterprise policies are deprecated.Chrome 135 on Windows,  macOS, Linux

- Partitioning :visited links historyTo eliminate user browsing history leaks, anchor elements are styled as:visitedonly if they have been clicked from this top-level site and frame origin before. On the browser-side, this means that the VisitedLinks hashtable is now partitioned by triple-keying, or by storing the following for each visited link:<link URL, top-level site, frame origin>. By only styling links that have been clicked on this site and frame before, the many side-channel attacks that have been developed to obtain:visitedlinks styling information are now obsolete, as they no longer provide sites with new information about users.There is an exception forself-links, where links to a site's own pages can be styled as :visited even if they have not been clicked on in this exact top-level site and frame origin before. This exemption is only enabled in top-level frames or subframes, which are same-origin with the top-level frame. The privacy benefits above are still achieved because sites already know which of its subpages a user has visited, so no new information is exposed. This was a community-requested exception that improves user experience as well.Chrome 135 on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android

- UI Automation accessibility framework provider on WindowsStarting in Chrome 126, Chrome started directly supporting accessibility client software that uses Microsoft Windows's UI Automation accessibility framework. Prior to this change, such software interoperated with Chrome by way of a compatibility shim in Microsoft Windows. This change is being made to improve the accessible user experience for many users. It provides complete support for Narrator, Magnifier, and Voice Access; and will improve third-party apps that use Windows's UI Automation accessibility framework. Users of Chrome will find reduced memory usage and processing overhead when used with accessibility tools. It will also ease development of software using assistive technologies.Admins might use theUiAutomationProviderEnabledenterprise policy, available from Chrome 125, to either force-enable the new provider (so that all users receive the new functionality), or disable the new provider. This policy will be supported through Chrome 136, and will be removed in Chrome 137.

- Remove SwiftShader fallbackAs early as Chrome 137, we plan to deprecate automatic fallback to WebGL backed by SwiftShader. WebGL context creation will fail instead of falling back to SwiftShader. We plan to remove SwiftShader fallback  for two primary reasons:SwiftShader is a high security risk due to JIT-ed code running in Chromium's GPU process.Users have a poor experience when falling back from a high-performance GPU-backed WebGL to a CPU-backed implementation. Users have no control over this behavior and it is difficult to describe in bug reports.SwiftShaderis a useful tool for web developers to test their sites on systems that are headless or do not have a supported GPU. This use case will still be supported by opting in but is not intended for running untrusted content.To opt-in to lower security guarantees and allow SwiftShader for WebGL, run the chrome executable with the--enable-unsafe-swiftshadercommand-line switch.During the deprecation period, a warning will appear in the JavaScript console when a WebGL context is created and backed with SwiftShader. Passing--enable-unsafe-swiftshaderwill remove this warning message.Chromium and other browsers do not guarantee WebGL availability. You can test and handle WebGL context creation failure and fall back to other web APIs such as Canvas2D or an appropriate message to the user.Chrome 137 on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android

- Slow KeysSlow Keys is an accessibility feature designed to assist individuals with limited dexterity in typing more accurately. This feature is particularly helpful for those who have conditions such as tremors, arthritis, or numbness in their fingertips, which can make it difficult to press keys with precision.Slow Keys works by introducing a delay, requiring keys to be held down for a set amount of time before they are registered. This will prevent unintended keystrokes from being pressed.

- Ad-hoc code signatures for PWA shims on macOSCode signatures for the application shims that are created when installing a Progressive Web App (PWA) on macOS are changing to use ad-hoc code signatures that are created when the application is installed. The code signature is used by macOS as part of the application's identity. These ad-hoc signatures result in each PWA shim having a unique identity to macOS, where previously every PWA looked like the same application to macOS.This update addresses problems when attempting to include multiple PWAs in theOpen at Loginpreference pane on macOS, and permits future improvements to handling of user notifications within PWAs on macOS.Admins should test for compatibility with any endpoint security or binary authorization tools they use (such as Santa). The feature can be enabled for this testing usingchrome://flags/#use-adhoc-signing-for-web-app-shims. They can then install a Progressive Web App and ensure that it launches as expected.If there is an incompatibility between the feature and their current security policies, theAdHocCodeSigningForPWAsEnabledpolicy can be used to disable the feature while they deploy an updated endpoint security policy. The enterprise policy is intended to be used to disable the feature only until endpoint security policies have been updated, at which point it should be unset.Chrome 129 on macOSFeature disabled behind a flag (chrome://flags/#use-adhoc-signing-for-web-app-shims) so that enterprises can test for compatibility with their endpoint security tools, such asSanta. If it is not currently compatible they can disable the feature via the enterprise policy while they update their endpoint security configurations.

- New option in HttpsOnlyMode policyAsk Before HTTP (ABH), previously named HTTPS Only/First Modes, allows Chrome to ask for user consent before sending insecure HTTP content over the wire. TheHttpsOnlyModepolicy allows force-enabling, or force-disabling, ABH.In Chrome 129, we added a new middle-ground variant of ABH called "balanced mode". This variant aims to reduce user inconvenience by working like (strict) ABH most of the time, but not asking when Chrome knows that an HTTPS connection isn't possible (such as when connecting to a single-label hostname like internal/).We are adding a force_balanced_enabled policy option to allow force-enabling this new variant. Setting force_balanced_enabled on browsers before Chrome 129 will result in the default behavior, which places no enterprise restrictions on the ABH setting.To avoid unexpected impact, if you have previously set force_enabled, we recommend not setting force_balanced_enabled until your entire fleet has upgraded to Chrome 129 or higher. If you are not migrating from force_enabled to force_balanced_enabled, you will be unaffected by this change.Chrome 129 on ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, FuchsiaChrome 133 on Android

- Blob URL Partitioning: Fetching/NavigationAs a continuation of Storage Partitioning, Chromium will implement partitioning of Blob URL access by Storage Key (top-level site, frame origin, and the has-cross-site-ancestor boolean), with the exception of top-level navigations which will remain partitioned only by frame origin. This behavior is similar to what’s currently implemented by both Firefox and Safari, and aligns Blob URL usage with the partitioning scheme used by other storage APIs as part of Storage Partitioning. In addition, Chromium will enforce noopener on renderer-initiated top-level navigations to Blob URLs where the corresponding site is cross-site to the top-level site performing the navigation. This aligns Chromium with similar behavior in Safari, and the relevant specs have been updated to reflect these changes.This change can be temporarily reverted by setting thePartitionedBlobURLUsage policy. The policy will be deprecated when the other storage partitioning related enterprise policies are deprecated.Chrome 134 on Windows,  macOS, Linux

- Fire error event instead of throwing exception for CSP blocked workerWhen blocked by the Content Security Policy (CSP), Chromium currently throws a SecurityError exception from the  "new Worker(url)" or "new SharedWorker(url)" constructors. According to theCSP specification,  the CSP check is performed as part of a fetch and an error event should fire after the object is returned. This update aims to make Chromium spec-conformant, by not throwing an exception from the constructor but instead firing an error event asynchronously.Chrome 134 on Windows,  macOS, Linux, Android

- Remove nonstandard getUserMedia audio constraintsBlink supports a number of nonstandard goog-prefixed constraints for getUserMedia from some time before constraints were properly standardized.Usage has gone down significantly ~0.000001% to 0.0009% (depending on the constraint) and some of them do not even have an effect due to changes in the Chromium audio-capture stack. Soon none of them will have any effect due to other upcoming changes.We do not expect any major regressions due to this change.

- Remove SwiftShader fallbackAllowing automatic fallback to WebGL backed by SwiftShader is deprecated and WebGL context creation will fail instead of falling back to SwiftShader. This was done for two primary reasons:SwiftShader is a high security risk due to JIT-ed code running in Chromium's GPU process.Users have a poor experience when falling back from a high-performance GPU-backed WebGL to a CPU-backed implementation. Users have no control over this behavior and it is difficult to describe in bug reports.SwiftShader is a useful tool for web developers to test their sites on systems that are headless or do not have a supported GPU. This use case will still be supported by opting in but is not intended for running untrusted content.To opt-in to lower security guarantees and allow SwiftShader for WebGL, run the chrome executable with the --enable-unsafe-swiftshader command-line switch.During the deprecation period, a warning will appear in the JavaScript console when a WebGL context is created and backed with SwiftShader. Passing --enable-unsafe-swiftshader will remove this warning message.Chromium and other browsers do not guarantee WebGL availability.

- UI Automation accessibility framework provider on WindowsStarting in Chrome 126, Chrome started directly supporting accessibility client software that uses Microsoft Windows's UI Automation accessibility framework. Prior to this change, such software interoperated with Chrome by way of a compatibility shim in Microsoft Windows. This change is being made to improve the accessible user experience for many users. It provides complete support for Narrator, Magnifier, and Voice Access; and will improve third-party apps that use Windows's UI Automation accessibility framework. Users of Chrome will find reduced memory usage and processing overhead when used with accessibility tools. It will also ease development of software using assistive technologies.Admins might use theUiAutomationProviderEnabledenterprise policy, available from Chrome 125, to either force-enable the new provider (so that all users receive the new functionality), or disable the new provider. This policy will be supported through Chrome 136, and will be removed in Chrome 137.

- New ChromeOS policy for battery longevityIn ChromeOS 134, we will introduce a new battery charge limit policy that will offer more optimization options, which will help extend the lifespan of Chromebooks. Administrators will still be able to set a maximum charge limit, with 100% as the default, to minimize battery degradation and improve long-term reliability. This new policy will benefit both administrators managing fleets of devices, such as in educational settings, and individual users seeking to maximize their Chromebook's longevity. This policy will automatically apply and will require no user interaction.

- Slow KeysSlow Keys is an accessibility feature designed to assist individuals with limited dexterity in typing more accurately. This feature is particularly helpful for those who have conditions such as tremors, arthritis, or numbness in their fingertips, which can make it difficult to press keys with precision. Slow Keys will work by introducing a delay, requiring keys to be held down for a set amount of time before they are registered. This will prevent unintended keystrokes from being pressed.

- Network Service sandboxed on WindowsTo improve security and reliability, the network service, already running in its own process, is now sandboxed on Windows. As part of this, third-party code that is currently able to tamper with the network service may be prevented from doing so. This might cause interoperability issues with software that injects code into Chrome's process space, such as Data Loss Prevention software. TheNetworkServiceSandboxEnabledpolicy allows you to disable the sandbox if incompatibilities are discovered.

- Ad-hoc code signatures for Progressive Web App shims on macOSCode signatures for the application shims that are created when installing a Progressive Web App on macOS are changing to use ad-hoc code signatures that are created when the application is installed. The code signature is used by macOS as part of the application's identity. These ad-hoc signatures result in each PWA app shim having a unique identity to macOS, where previously every PWA looked like the same application to macOS.This update addresses problems when attempting to include multiple Progressive Web Applications in macOS'sOpen at Loginpreference pane, and permits future improvements to handling of user notifications within PWAs on macOS.Admins should test for compatibility with any endpoint security or binary authorization tools they use (such asSanta). The feature can be enabled for this testing usingchrome://flags/#use-adhoc-signing-for-web-app-shims. They can then install a Progressive Web App and ensure that it launches as expected.If there is an incompatibility between the feature and their current security policies, theAdHocCodeSigningForPWAsEnabledpolicy can be used to disable the feature while they deploy an updated endpoint security policy. The enterprise policy is intended to be used to disable the feature only until endpoint security policies have been updated, at which point it should be unset.Chrome 129 on macOSFeature disabled behind a flag (chrome://flags/#use-adhoc-signing-for-web-app-shims) so that enterprises can test for compatibility with their endpoint security tools, such asSanta.

- Batch uploadSince Chrome 128, users have access to their passwords and addresses from their Google Account at the point of sign-in (in addition to their payment methods, which was an existing sign-in feature). These data-types have two distinct storages: local and account. With Chrome 132, we are providing users an opportunity to upload any local data they have to their Google Account. This will first be made available for passwords and addresses and will be expanded to include other data types in the future.TheSyncTypesListDisabledpolicy applies equally to sync and data upload. Therefore, if either passwords or addresses are disabled, they are not made available for upload in the batch uploader.Chrome 132 on Linux, macOS, Windows

This means, however, that the policy is now much stricter on certain file types that could be dangerous to the user, like `.exe` or `.msi` files on Windows. If this induces too many false positives, you can leave the policy unset or set the policy value to 4.

- Updates to Chrome Identity model on desktopInstead of having to set up Chrome sync on your device, you can now simply sign in to Chrome to access and save items to your Google Account. This new identity model on Desktop also includes an explicit sign-in to Chrome from a web sign-in.Signing into the web (using Gmail) prompts users to sign-in to Chrome. If they decline, they won’t be signed-in to Chrome, only to the web.If they accept, profile management (user-based policies), payments (already available today), passwords, addresses, bookmarks*, extensions*, search engine prefs*, themes* and PWAs* will be enabled.If they decline, Chrome can still use the sign-in credentials to facilitate a one-click sign-in to Chrome.Synchronizing history, Open tabs and tab groups still exist behind a separate opt-in for now.Invalidated credentials (e.g. signing out of the web or remote sign-out) will put Chrome in a ‘pending’ state, previously ‘sync paused’. Autofill data will not be available from the user’s Google Account. Users in this state will be prompted to “Verify it’s you” in the Chrome toolbar.*These data types will be enabled behind sign-in (instead of sync opt in) in upcoming Chrome milestones.Web sign-in intercepts can be controlled using theSigninInterceptionEnabledpolicy.

- HTTPS-First Mode for Typically Secure UsersHTTPS-First Mode (HFM) enables a default-HTTPS experience in Chrome by automatically upgrading sites to HTTPS. If a site doesn’t support HTTPS, HFM shows a warning before loading the HTTP version. HFM significantly improves the security guarantees of HTTPS by preventing loading of HTTP URLs without explicit user approval.HFM for typically secure users (this feature) is a heuristic that can automatically enable HFM for the user if the user has a typically secure browsing pattern. Typically secure browsing pattern is determined by keeping track of HTTPS-Upgrade fallbacks (failed HTTPS Upgrades, which would be HFM interstitials if the user manually enabled HFM) and a few other factors such as profile age and overall site engagement score.If these signals indicate that the user mostly visits secure sites, the heuristic will automatically enable HFM setting. HFM interstitials caused by this heuristic will display a custom message. The user can disable HFM by simply turning off the UI setting and the heuristic will never kick in again.This feature can be controlled using the existing enterprise policiesHttpsOnlyModeandHttpAllowlist.Chrome 132 on ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Fuchsia

- User Link capturing on PWAsWeb links automatically direct users to installed web apps. To better align with users' expectations around installed web apps, Chrome makes it easier to move between the browser and installed web apps. When the user clicks a link that could be handled by an installed web app, Chrome adds a chip in the address bar to suggest switching over to the app. When the user clicks the chip, this either launches the app directly, or opens a grid of apps that can support that link. For some users, clicking a link always automatically opens the app.When some users click a link, it always opens in an installed PWA, while some users see the link open in a new tab with a chip in the address bar and clicking the chip launches the app. A flag is available to control this feature:chrome://flags/#enable-user-link-capturing-pwa.Chrome 132 on Linux, macOS, WindowsLaunch to 100% of Stable with either a default on (always launch apps on link clicks) or a default off (always open in a tab, only launch if the user clicks on chip on address bar).

- Keyboard-focusable scroll containersImproves accessibility by making scroll containers focusable using sequential focus navigation. Today, the tab key doesn't focus scrollers unless tabIndex is explicitly set to 0 or more.By making scrollers focusable by default, users who can't (or don't want to) use a mouse will be able to focus clipped content using a keyboard's tab and arrow keys. This behavior is enabled only if the scroller does not contain any keyboard focusable children. This logic is necessary so we don't cause regressions for existing focusable elements that might exist within a scroller like a <textarea>.Note:The previous rollout of this feature (started first in Chrome 127 and again in Chrome 130) was stopped due to an accessibility regression, which should be fixed in the current implementation shipping in Chrome 132.Chrome 132 on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android

- Remove nonstandard getUserMedia audio constraintsBlink supports a number of nonstandard goog-prefixed constraints for getUserMedia from some time before constraints were properly standardized.Usage has gone down significantly ~0.000001% to 0.0009% (depending on the constraint) and some of them do not even have an effect due to changes in the Chromium audio-capture stack. Soon none of them will have any effect due to other upcoming changes.We do not expect any major regressions due to this change. Applications using these constraints will continue to work, but will get audio with default settings (as if no constraints were passed).

- Remove SwiftShader fallbackAllowing automatic fallback to WebGL backed by SwiftShader is deprecated and WebGL context creation will fail instead of falling back to SwiftShader. This was done for two primary reasons:SwiftShader is a high security risk due to JIT-ed code running in Chromium's GPU process.Users have a poor experience when falling back from a high-performance GPU-backed WebGL to a CPU-backed implementation. Users have no control over this behavior and it is difficult to describe in bug reports.SwiftShader is a useful tool for web developers to test their sites on systems that are headless or do not have a supported GPU. This use case will still be supported by opting in but is not intended for running untrusted content.To opt-in to lower security guarantees and allow SwiftShader for WebGL, run the chrome executable with the --enable-unsafe-swiftshader command-line switch.During the deprecation period, a warning will appear in the JavaScript console when a WebGL context is created and backed with SwiftShader. Passing--enable-unsafe-swiftshaderwill remove this warning message.Chromium and other browsers do not guarantee WebGL availability. You can test and handle WebGL context creation failure and fall back to other web APIs such as Canvas2D or an appropriate message to the user.Chrome 133 on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android

- New option in HttpsOnlyMode policyAsk Before HTTP (ABH, formerly HTTPS Only/First Modes) is a setting that tells Chrome to ask for user consent before sending insecure HTTP content over the wire. TheHttpsOnlyModpolicy allows force-enabling, or force-disabling, ABH.In Chrome 129, we are adding a new middle-ground variant of ABH called "balanced mode". This variant aims to reduce user inconvenience by working like (strict) ABH most of the time, but not asking when Chrome knows that an HTTPS connection isn't possible (such as when connecting to a single-label hostname like internal/).We are adding a force_balanced_enabled policy option to allow force-enabling this new variant. Setting force_balanced_enabled on browsers before Chrome 129 will result in the default behavior, which places no enterprise restrictions on the ABH setting.To avoid unexpected impact, if you have previously set force_enabled, we recommend not setting force_balanced_enabled until your entire fleet has upgraded to Chrome 129 or higher. If you are not migrating from force_enabled to force_balanced_enabled, you will be unaffected by this change.Chrome 129 on ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, FuchsiaChrome 133 on Android

- Blob URL Partitioning: Fetching or NavigationAs a continuation of Storage Partitioning, Chromium will implement partitioning of Blob URL access by Storage Key (top-level site, frame origin, and the has-cross-site-ancestor boolean), with the exception of navigations which will remain partitioned only by frame origin. This behavior is similar to what’s currently implemented by both Firefox and Safari, and aligns Blob URL usage with the partitioning scheme used by other storage APIs as part of Storage Partitioning. In addition, Chromium will enforce noopener on renderer-initiated navigations to Blob URLs where the corresponding site is cross-site to the top-level site performing the navigation. This aligns Chromium with similar behavior in Safari, and we will pursue spec updates to reflect both of these changes.This change can be temporarily reverted by setting thePartitionedBlobURLUsagepolicy, which will be available in Chrome 134. The policy will be deprecated when the other storage partitioning related enterprise policies are deprecated.Chrome 134 on Windows, macOS, Linux

Prior to this change, such software interoperated with Chrome by way of a compatibility shim in Microsoft Windows. This change is being made to improve the accessible user experience for many users. It provides complete support for Narrator, Magnifier, and Voice Access; and will improve third-party apps that use Windows's UI Automation accessibility framework.

- Search with Google Lens on iOSSince Chrome 126, users can search any images or text they see on their screen with Google Lens. To use this feature, go to a website and clickSearch with Google Lenson the on-focus omnibox chip and on the right-click menus on desktop, or on the 3-dot menu on both desktop and mobile. Users can click, highlight, or drag anywhere on the screen to search its contents, and refine their search by adding keywords or questions to the search box. Admins can control the feature through a policy calledLensOverlaySettings. To perform the search, a screenshot of the screen is sent to Google servers but it is not linked to any IDs or accounts, it is not viewed by any human, and data about its contents is not logged. We are starting the rollout of this feature gradually on iOS in Chrome 131 and we plan to launch fully in Chrome 132.Chrome 126 on ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, Windows: Rollout of the feature at 1% StableChrome 127 on ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, Windows: Rollout to 100% StableChrome 131 on iOS:Rollout of the feature startsChrome 132 on iOS: Rollout to 100% Stable

Today Safe Browsing checks are on the blocking path of page loads, meaning that the user cannot see the page until the checks are completed. To improve Chrome's loading speed, real-time Safe Browsing checks will no longer block page loads after Chrome 122, and after Chrome 131 on iOS.


We have evaluated the risk and put mitigations in place:


1. For malware and 0-day attacks, local-blocklist checks will still be conducted in synchronous manner so that malicious payloads are still blocked by Safe Browsing.
2. For phishing attacks, we've looked at data and it is unlikely the user would have interacted with the page (for example, typed a password) by the time we show the warning.

- Ad-hoc code signatures for PWA shims on macOSCode signatures for the application shims that are created when installing a Progressive Web App (PWA) on macOS are changing to use ad-hoc code signatures that are created when the application is installed. The code signature is used by macOS as part of the application's identity. These ad-hoc signatures result in each PWA app shim having a unique identity to macOS; currently every PWA looks like the same application to macOS.This addresses problems when attempting to include multiple PWAs in the macOSOpen at Loginpreference pane, and permits future improvements to handling of user notifications within PWAs on macOS.Administrators should test for compatibility with any endpoint security or binary authorization tools they use (such asSanta). The feature can be switched on for testing using thechrome://flags/#use-adhoc-signing-for-web-app-shimsflag. Admins can then install a PWA and ensure that it launches as expected.If there is an incompatibility between the feature and their current security policies, theAdHocCodeSigningForPWAsEnabledpolicy can be used to disable the feature while they deploy an updated endpoint security policy. The enterprise policy is intended to be used to disable the feature only until endpoint security policies have been updated, at which point it should be unset.Chrome 129 on macOSThis feature is turned on with a flag (chrome://flags/#use-adhoc-signing-for-web-app-shims) so that enterprises can test for compatibility with their endpoint security tools, such asSanta.

- Chrome PDF Viewer OCRChrome Desktop now makes scanned PDFs more accessible. Using on-device Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to maintain privacy (no content is sent to Google), Chrome automatically converts scanned PDFs, allowing you to select text, Ctrl+F, copy, and paste. The feature does not bypass secure PDFs. It only uses OCR on PDFs the user has access to.

- Chrome on Android now supports 3P autofill and password providersUntil now, third-party autofill and password providers could be used in Chrome on Android via accessibility APIs.In Chrome M131, we're adding direct support for Android Autofill, which means these providers will work with Chrome on Android without the need for accessibility APIs. This should improve the performance of Chrome on Android and third-party autofill providers.To take advantage of this, users will need to configure their third-party provider in Android settings. Then, in Chrome, users selectSettings > Autofill servicesand chooseAutofill using another service.If users do not change both settings, they will continue to use Google to autofill their passwords, payment and address information. Whether users can use a third-party autofill service or not can be controlled by a new policy calledThirdPartyPasswordManagersAllowed.Chrome 131 on AndroidThe new setting will be available from Chrome 131. If users use the new setting, it will take immediate effect. If the new setting is not used, users will continue to use either Google or a third party via accessibility (if installed).The support for accessibility APIs will be deprecated in early 2025, at which point the new policy settings will apply to all users.

- Simplified sign-in and sync experienceStarting in Chrome 131, existing users with Chrome sync turned on now experience a simplified and consolidated version of sign-in and sync in Chrome. Chrome sync is no longer shown as a separate feature in settings or elsewhere. Instead, users can sign in to Chrome to use and save information like passwords, bookmarks and more in their Google Account, subject to the relevant enterprise policies.As before, the functionality previously part of Chrome sync that saves and accesses Chrome data in the Google Account can be controlled bySyncTypesListDisabled. Sign-in to Chrome can be switched off viaBrowserSigninas before.Note that the changes do not affect users’ ability to sign in to Google services on the web (like Gmail) without signing in to Chrome, their ability to stay signed out of Chrome, or their ability to control what information is synced with their Google Account.Chrome 131 on Android

- X25519Kyber768 key encapsulation for TLSStarting in Chrome 124, Chrome enables by default on all desktop platforms a new post-quantum secure TLS key encapsulation mechanism X25519Kyber768, based on a NIST standard (ML-KEM). This protects network traffic from Chrome with servers that also support ML-KEM from decryption by a future quantum computer. This change should be transparent to server operators. This cipher will be used for both TLS 1.3 and QUIC connections.However, some TLS middleboxes might be unprepared for the size of a Kyber (ML-KEM) key encapsulation, or a new TLS ClientHello cipher code point, leading to dropped or hanging connections. This can be resolved by updating your middlebox, or disabling the key encapsulation mechanism via the temporaryPostQuantumKeyAgreementEnabledenterprise policy, which will be available through the end of 2024. However, long term, post-quantum secure ciphers will be required in TLS and the enterprise policy will be removed. Post-quantum cryptography is required for CSNA 2.0.For more detail, see thisChromium blogpost and thisGoogle Security blogpost.Chrome 124 on Windows, macOS, Linux: new post-quantum secure TLS key encapsulation mechanism X25519Kyber768 is enabledChrome 131 on Linux, macOS, Windows: Chrome will switch the key encapsulation mechanism to the final standard version of ML-KEMChrome 141 on Windows, macOS, Linux: Remove enterprise policy

- Chrome 141 on Windows, macOS, Linux: Remove enterprise policy


Starting in Chrome 124, Chrome enables by default on all desktop platforms a new post-quantum secure TLS key encapsulation mechanism X25519Kyber768, based on a NIST standard (ML-KEM). This protects network traffic from Chrome with servers that also support ML-KEM from decryption by a future quantum computer. This change should be transparent to server operators. This cipher will be used for both TLS 1.3 and QUIC connections.


However, some TLS middleboxes might be unprepared for the size of a Kyber (ML-KEM) key encapsulation, or a new TLS ClientHello cipher code point, leading to dropped or hanging connections. This can be resolved by updating your middlebox, or disabling the key encapsulation mechanism via the temporaryPostQuantumKeyAgreementEnabledenterprise policy, which will be available through the end of 2024. However, long term, post-quantum secure ciphers will be required in TLS and the enterprise policy will be removed. Post-quantum cryptography is required for CSNA 2.0.

- Keyboard-focusable scroll containersWe plan to improve accessibility by making scroll containers focusable using sequential focus navigation. Today, the tab key doesn't focus scrollers unless tabIndex is explicitly set to 0 or more.By making scrollers focusable by default, users who can't (or don't want to) use a mouse will be able to focus clipped content using their tab and arrow keys. This behavior is enabled only if the scroller does not contain any keyboard focusable children. This logic is necessary so we don't cause regressions for existing focusable elements that might exist within a scroller like a<textarea>.Note: The previous rollout of this feature (started in Chrome 127)  was stopped due to web compatibility issues, which should be fixed in the current implementation shipping in 130.Note:The previous rollout of this feature (started in 130) was stopped due to an accessibility regression, which should be fixed in the implementation shipping in 132.Chrome 132 on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android

- Throw exception for popovers or dialogs in non-active documentsThis is a corner case change that hopefully does not impact developers. A corner case is where multiple unique conditions occur simultaneously.

Since the document is inactive, however, no popover or dialog would be shown.

- User Link capturing on PWAsWeb links automatically direct users to installed web apps. To better align with users' expectations around installed web apps, Chrome makes it easier to move between the browser and installed web apps. When the user clicks a link that could be handled by an installed web app, Chrome adds a chip in the address bar to suggest switching over to the app. When the user clicks the chip, this either launches the app directly, or opens a grid of apps that can support that link. For some users, clicking a link always automatically opens the app.Chrome 121 on Linux, macOS, WindowsWhen some users click a link, it always opens in an installed PWA, while some users see the link open in a new tab with a chip in the address bar, clicking on which will launch the app. A flag is available to control this feature:chrome://flags/#enable-user-link-capturing-pwa.Chrome 132 on Linux, macOS, WindowsLaunch to 100% of Stable with either a default on (always launch apps on link clicks) or a default off (always open in a tab, only launch if the user clicks on chip on address bar).

When the user clicks a link that could be handled by an installed web app, Chrome adds a chip in the address bar to suggest switching over to the app. When the user clicks the chip, this either launches the app directly, or opens a grid of apps that can support that link. For some users, clicking a link always automatically opens the app.


- Chrome 121 on Linux, macOS, WindowsWhen some users click a link, it always opens in an installed PWA, while some users see the link open in a new tab with a chip in the address bar, clicking on which will launch the app. A flag is available to control this feature:chrome://flags/#enable-user-link-capturing-pwa.


- Chrome 132 on Linux, macOS, WindowsLaunch to 100% of Stable with either a default on (always launch apps on link clicks) or a default off (always open in a tab, only launch if the user clicks on chip on address bar).








- Network Service on Windows will be sandboxedTo improve security and reliability, the network service, already running in its own process, will be sandboxed on Windows. As part of this, third-party code that is currently able to tamper with the network service may be prevented from doing so. This might cause interoperability issues with software that injects code into Chrome's process space, such as Data Loss Prevention software. TheNetworkServiceSandboxEnabledpolicy allows you to disable the sandbox if incompatibilities are discovered.

- Remove SwiftShader fallbackAllowing automatic fallback to WebGL backed by SwiftShader is deprecated and WebGL context creation will fail instead of falling back to SwiftShader. This was done for two primary reasons:SwiftShader is a high security risk due to JIT-ed code running in Chromium's GPU process.Users have a poor experience when falling back from a high-performance GPU-backed WebGL to a CPU-backed implementation. Users have no control over this behavior and it is difficult to describe in bug reports.SwiftShader is a useful tool for web developers to test their sites on systems that are headless or do not have a supported GPU. This use case will still be supported by opting in but is not intended for running untrusted content.To opt in to lower security guarantees and allow SwiftShader for WebGL, run the chrome executable with the--enable-unsafe-swiftshadercommand-line switch.During the deprecation period, a warning will appear in the JavaScript console when a WebGL context is created and backed with SwiftShader. Passing--enable-unsafe-swiftshaderwill remove this warning message.Chromium and other browsers do not guarantee WebGL availability. You can test and handle WebGL context creation failure and fall back to other web APIs such as Canvas2D or an appropriate message to the user.Chrome 133 on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android

- Blob URL partitioning: Fetching or NavigationAs a continuation of Storage partitioning, Chromium will implement partitioning of Blob URL access by Storage Key (top-level site, frame origin, and thehas-cross-site-ancestorboolean), with the exception of navigations that will remain partitioned only by frame origin. This behavior is similar to what’s currently implemented by both Firefox and Safari, and aligns Blob URL usage with the partitioning scheme used by other storage APIs as part of Storage Partitioning. In addition, Chromium will enforce noopener on renderer-initiated navigations to Blob URLs where the corresponding site is cross-site to the top-level site performing the navigation. This aligns Chromium with similar behavior in Safari, and we will pursue spec updates to reflect both of these changes.This change can be temporarily reverted by setting thePartitionedBlobURLUsagepolicy. The policy will be deprecated when the other storage partitioning-related enterprise policies are deprecated.Chrome 134 on Windows, macOS, Linux

- ChromeOS Flex auto-enrollmentIn ChromeOS 131, ChromeOS Flex auto-enrollment now allows you to deploy ChromeOS Flex devices at scale. Similar to ChromeOS zero-touch enrollment, automatic enrollment embeds an enrollment token created by an organization's administrator into a ChromeOS Flex image. This will determine which customer organization and organizational unit a device will enroll into during initial device setup. For more information, seeEnroll ChromeOS devicesand theChromeOS Flexhelp center.

- Microsoft SCEP SID update reminderOnly for SCEP deployments using Microsoft NPS for RADIUS. If you are not using SCEP certificatesin combination with Microsoft NPS for Radius for Chromebook network connectivity,you may disregard the remainder of these instructions. We expect this to be a setup more common in enterprise rather than in education.Microsoft has announced a security update that will add a new required field, a Security Identifier (SID), to SCEP certificates in environments utilizing NPS for Radius for network authentication. This addition is due to a security vulnerability on Windows devices where usable certificates with private keys can be exported from one Windows device to be used on any other device. Addition of the SID means that the certificate becomes linked to a device or user in your Active Directory environment so that an unknown device/user cannot use it. This is not a security issue for Chromebooks, as they do not allow the exporting of certificates with private keys in them and they are protected by the TPM. However, any certificate lacking this new field will fail to authenticate against a NPS for Radius server after the hard enforcement deadline of February 11th, 2025.What do you need to do?As soon as possible, verify if your deployment relies on both SCEP certificates and NPS for Radius for network authentication.

- Tab freezing on Energy saverWhen Energy saver is active, Chrome now freezes a tab that has been hidden and silent for >5 minutes and uses a lot of CPU, unless:the tab provides audio- or video- conferencing functionality (detected via microphone, camera or screen, window, or tab capture, or an RTCPeerConnection with an open RTCDataChannel or a live MediaStreamTrack).the tab controls an external device (detected using Web USB, Web Bluetooth, Web HID or Web Serial).This will extend battery life and speed up Chrome through reduced CPU usage.Chrome 130 on ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, Windows:The feature can be tested in Chrome 130 via the#freezing-on-energy-saverentry in about:flags. Alternatively, it can be tested with the#freezing-on-energy-saver-testingwhich simulates that Energy saver is active and that all tabs use a lot of CPU (this allows verifying whether a tab is eligible for freezing and would be frozen if it used a lot of CPU).

- Keyboard-focusable scroll containersChrome 130 improves accessibility by making scroll containers focusable using sequential focus navigation. Today, the tab key doesn't focus scrollers unless tabIndex is explicitly set to 0 or more.By making scrollers focusable by default, users who can't (or don't want to) use a mouse can now focus clipped content using tab and arrow keys. This behavior is enabled only if the scroller does not contain any keyboard-focusable children. This logic is necessary so we don't cause regressions for existing focusable elements that might exist within a scroller like a<textarea>.Note:The previous rollout of this feature (started in Chrome 127) was stopped due to web compatibility issues, which should be fixed in the implementation shipping in Chrome 130.Chrome 130 on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android

- Support non-special scheme URLsChrome 130 supportsnon-special scheme URLs, for example,git://example.com/path. Previously, the Chromium URL parser didn't support non-special URLs. The parser parses non-special URLs as if they had an opaque path, which is not aligned with the URL standard. Now, the Chromium URL parser parses non-special URLs correctly, following the URL standard. For more details, seehttp://bit.ly/url-non-special.Chrome 130 on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android

- Chrome on Android now supports third-party autofill and password providersUntil now, third-party autofill and password providers could be used in Chrome on Android via accessibility APIs. In Chrome 130, we're adding direct support for Android Autofill which means these providers now work with Chrome on Android without the need for accessibility APIs. This should improve the performance of Chrome on Android. To take advantage of this, users need to ensure they have their third party provider configured in Android settings. Then, in Chrome they'll need to openSettings > Autofill servicesand chooseAutofill using another service. If users do not changebothsettings, they will continue to use Google to autofill their passwords, payment and address information.Chrome 130 on Android:The new setting will be available from Chrome 130. If users use the new setting it will take immediate effect. If the new setting is not used, users will continue to use either Google and a third party via accessibility (if installed). The support for accessibility APIs will be deprecated in early 2025, at which point the new settings will be honored for all users.

- Audit-only URL navigation rulesThis feature lets customers create Chrome URL navigation rules with the Audit action. These rules allow admins to dry-run URL navigation rules before starting to show user warnings. They also allow admins to silently audit users’ navigation to restricted or sensitive URLs.URL auditing is part of the existing real-time URL check connector policy,EnterpriseRealTimeUrlCheckMode, which can be turned on by Organizational Unit or by Group.Chrome 130 on ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, Windows

- Ad-hoc code signatures for Progressive Web App shims on macOSCode signatures for application shims that are created when installing a Progressive Web App (PWA) on macOS are changing to use ad-hoc code signatures, which are created when the application is installed. The code signature is used by macOS as part of the application's identity. These ad-hoc signatures will result in each PWA shim having a unique identity to macOS; currently every PWA looks like the same application to macOS.This will address problems when attempting to include multiple PWAs in the macOSOpen at Loginpreference pane, and will permit future improvements for handling user notifications within PWAs on macOS.Administrators should test for compatibility with any endpoint security or binary authorization tools they use (such as Santa). The feature can be enabled for this testing viachrome://flags/#use-adhoc-signing-for-web-app-shims. They can then install a Progressive Web Apps and ensure that it launches as expected.If there is an incompatibility between the feature and their current security policies, the enterprise policy,AdHocCodeSigningForPWAsEnabled, can be used to disable the feature while they deploy an updated endpoint security policy. The enterprise policy is intended to be used to disable the feature only until endpoint security policies have been updated, at which point it should be unset.Chrome 129 on macOS:Feature disabled behind a flag (chrome://flags/#use-adhoc-signing-for-web-app-shims) so that enterprises can test for compatibility with their endpoint security tools, such as Santa (https://santa.dev/).

- Asynchronous real-time Safe Browsing checkToday, Safe Browsing checks are on the blocking path of page loads, meaning that the user cannot see the page until the checks are completed. In Chrome 122 and later on Android, ChromeOS, LaCrOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, to improve Chrome's loading speed, real-time Safe Browsing checks no longer block page loads. We have evaluated the risk and put mitigations in place:For malware and 0-day attacks, local-blocklist checks will still be conducted in a synchronous manner so that malicious payloads are still blocked by Safe Browsing.For phishing attacks, we've looked at data and it is unlikely the user would have interacted with the page (for example, type a password) by the time we show the warning.Chrome 122 on Android, ChromeOS, LaCrOS, Linux, macOS, WindowsChrome 131 on iOS

- Entrust certificate distrustIn response to sustained compliance failures, Chrome 127 changes how publicly-trusted TLS server authentication, that is, websites or certificates issued by Entrust, are trusted by default. This applies to Chrome 127 and later on Windows, macOS, ChromeOS, Android, and Linux; iOS policies do not allow use of the Chrome Root Store in Chrome for iOS.Specifically, TLS certificates validating to the Entrust root CA certificates included in the Chrome Root Store and issued:- after October 31, 2024, will no longer be trusted by default.- on or before October 31, 2024, will be unaffected by this change.If a Chrome user or an enterprise explicitly trusts any of the affected Entrust certificates on a platform and version of Chrome relying on the Chrome Root Store, for example, when explicit trust is conveyed through a Windows Group Policy Object, the Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT) constraints described above will be overridden and certificates will function as they do today.For additional information and testing resources, seeSustaining Digital Certificate Security - Entrust Certificate Distrust.To learn more about the Chrome Root Store, see thisFAQ.Chrome 131 on Android, ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, Windows:All versions of Chrome 131 and higher that rely on the Chrome Root Store will honor the blocking action, but the blocking action will only begin for certificates issued after November 11, 2024.

- Simplified sign-in and sync experienceStarting in Chrome 131, existing users with Chrome sync turned on will experience a simplified and consolidated version of sign-in and sync in Chrome. Chrome sync will no longer be shown as a separate feature in settings or elsewhere. Instead, users can sign in to Chrome to use and save information like passwords, bookmarks and more in their Google Account, subject to the relevant enterprise policies.As before, the functionality previously part of Chrome sync that saves and accesses Chrome data in the Google Account can be controlled bySyncTypesListDisabled. Sign-in to Chrome can be disabled viaBrowserSigninas before.Note that the changes do not affect users’ ability to sign in to Google services on the web (like Gmail) without signing in to Chrome, their ability to stay signed out of Chrome, or their ability to control what information is synced with their Google Account.Chrome 131 on Android

- User Link capturing on PWAsWeb links automatically direct users to installed web apps. To better align with users' expectations around installed web apps, Chrome makes it easier to move between the browser and installed web apps. When the user clicks a link that could be handled by an installed web app, Chrome adds a chip in the address bar to suggest switching over to the app. When the user clicks the chip, this either launches the app directly, or opens a grid of apps that can support that link. For some users, clicking a link always automatically opens the app.Chrome 121 on Linux, macOS, Windows: When some users click a link, it always opens in an installed PWA, while some users see the link open in a new tab with a chip in the address bar, clicking on which will launch the app. A flag is available to control this feature:chrome://flags/#enable-user-link-capturing-pwa.Chrome 131 on Linux, macOS, Windows:Launch to 100% of Stable with either a default on (always launch apps on link clicks) or a default off (always open in a tab, only launch if the user clicks on chip on address bar).

- X25519Kyber768 key encapsulation for TLSStarting in Chrome 124, Chrome enables by default on all desktop platforms a new post-quantum secure TLS key encapsulation mechanism X25519Kyber768, based on a NIST standard (ML-KEM). This protects network traffic from Chrome with servers that also support ML-KEM from decryption by a future quantum computer. This change should be transparent to server operators. This cipher will be used for both TLS 1.3 and QUIC connections.However, some TLS middleboxes might be unprepared for the size of a Kyber (ML-KEM) key encapsulation, or a new TLS ClientHello cipher code point, leading to dropped or hanging connections. This can be resolved by updating your middlebox, or disabling the key encapsulation mechanism via the temporaryPostQuantumKeyAgreementEnabledenterprise policy, which will be available through the end of 2024. However, long term, post-quantum secure ciphers will be required in TLS and the enterprise policy will be removed. Post-quantum cryptography is required for CSNA 2.0.For more detail, see thisChromium blogpost and thisGoogle Security blogpost.Chrome 124 on Windows, Mac, Linux: new post-quantum secure TLS key encapsulation mechanism X25519Kyber768 is enabledChrome 131 on Windows, Mac, Linux:Switch to standard version of ML-KEMChrome 141 on Windows, Mac, Linux: Remove enterprise policyPostQuantumKeyAgreementEnabled

- Capture all screensThis feature captures all the screens currently connected to the device usinggetAllScreensMedia(). CallinggetDisplayMedia()multiple times requires multiple user gestures, burdens the user with choosing the next screen each time, and does not guarantee to the app that all the screens were selected.getAllScreensMedia()improves on all of these fronts.This feature is only exposed behind theMultiScreenCaptureAllowedForUrlsenterprise policy, and users are warned before recording even starts, that recordingcouldstart at some point. The API will only work for origins that are specified in theMultiScreenCaptureAllowedForUrlsallowlist. Any origin not specified there, will not have access to it.Chrome 132 on ChromeOS

- Private network access checks for navigation requests: warning-only modeBefore a website A navigates to another site B in the user's private network, this feature does the following:1. Checks whether the request has been initiated from a secure context.2. Sends a preflight request, and checks whether B responds with a header that allows private network access.There are already features for subresources and workers, but this one is for navigation requests specifically. These checks protect the user's private network.Since this feature is the warning-only mode, we do not fail the requests if any of the checks fail. Instead, a warning will be shown in the DevTools console, to help developers prepare for the coming enforcement.Chrome 133 on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android

- Deprecate mutation eventsSynchronous mutation events, includingDOMSubtreeModified,DOMNodeInserted,DOMNodeRemoved,DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument,DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument, andDOMCharacterDataModified, negatively affect page performance, and also significantly increase the complexity of adding new features to the Web. These APIs were deprecated from the spec in 2011, and were replaced (in 2012) by the much better-behaved Mutation Observer API. Usage of the obsolete mutation events must be removed or migrated to Mutation Observer. Starting in Chrome 124, a temporary enterprise policy,MutationEventsEnabled, will be available to re-enable deprecated or removed mutation events. If you encounter any issues, file a bughere.Mutation event support will be disabled by default starting in Chrome 127, around July 30, 2024.

- UI Automation accessibility framework provider on WindowsStarting in Chrome 126, Chrome will start directly supporting accessibility client software that uses Microsoft Windows's UI Automation accessibility framework. Prior to this change, such software interoperated with Chrome by way of a compatibility shim in Microsoft Windows. This change is being made to improve the accessible user experience for many users. It provides complete support for Narrator, Magnifier, and Voice Access; and will improve third-party apps that use Windows's UI Automation accessibility framework. Users of Chrome will find reduced memory usage and processing overhead when used with accessibility tools. It will also ease development of software using assistive technologies.Administrators might use theUiAutomationProviderEnabledenterprise policy, available from Chrome 125, to either force-enable the new provider (so that all users receive the new functionality), or disable the new provider. This policy will be supported through Chrome 136, and will be removed in Chrome 137.

- Improved ARC++ user experienceTo improve ChromeOS and ARC++ user experience, we're moving ARC++ non-urgent background and error notifications to the system tray. This prevents these messages from unnecessarily popping up in the foreground and disrupting the user's journey. By moving these notifications to the system tray, we can ensure that users are still notified of potential issues but are not interrupted while using their Chromebook. For more information about ARC++, see thisChromeOS developer blog.

If you are not using SCEP certificatesin combination with Microsoft NPS for Radius for Chromebook network connectivity,you may disregard the remainder of these instructions. We expect this to be a setup more common in enterprise rather than in education.Microsoft has announced a security update that will add a new required field, a Security Identifier (SID), to SCEP certificates in environments utilizing NPS for Radius for network authentication. This addition is due to a security vulnerability on Windows devices where usable certificates with private keys can be exported from one Windows device to be used on any other device. Addition of the SID means that the certificate becomes linked to a device or user in your Active Directory environment so that an unknown device/user cannot use it. This is not a security issue for Chromebooks, as they do not allow the exporting of certificates with private keys in them and they are protected by the TPM. However, any certificate lacking this new field will fail to authenticate against a NPS for Radius server after the hard enforcement deadline of February 11th, 2025.What do you need to do?As soon as possible, verify if your deployment relies on both SCEP certificates and NPS for Radius for network authentication. This can be done by going into event viewer on yourDomain Controller -> System,and searching for event ID #39.

- Ad-hoc code signatures for PWA shims on macOSCode signatures for application shims that are created when installing a Progressive Web App (PWA) on macOS are changing to use ad-hoc code signatures, which are created when the application is installed. The code signature is used by macOS as part of the application's identity. These ad-hoc signatures will result in each PWA shim having a unique identity to macOS; currently every PWA looks like the same application to macOS.This addresses problems when attempting to include multiple PWAs in the macOSOpen at Loginpreference pane, and permits future improvements for handling user notifications within PWAs on macOS.Chrome 129 on macOS

- New option in HttpsOnlyMode policyAsk Before HTTP (ABH), formerly named HTTPS Only/First Modes, is a setting that tells Chrome to ask for user consent before sending insecure HTTP content over the wire. TheHttpsOnlyModepolicy allows force-enabling, or force-disabling, ABH.In Chrome 129, we are adding a new middle-ground variant of ABH calledbalanced mode. This variant aims to reduce user inconvenience by working like (strict) ABH most of the time, but not asking when Chrome knows that an HTTPS connection isn't possible, such as when connecting to a single-label hostname like internal/.We are adding aforce_balanced_enabledpolicy option to allow force-enabling this new variant. Settingforce_balanced_enabledon browsers before Chrome 129 will result in the default behavior, which places no enterprise restrictions on the ABH setting.To avoid unexpected impact, if you have previously setforce_enabled, we recommend not settingforce_balanced_enableduntil your entire fleet has upgraded to Chrome 129 or higher. If you are not migrating fromforce_enabledtoforce_balanced_enabled, you will be unaffected by this change.Chrome 129 on Android, ChromeOS, LaCrOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Fuchsia

- Deprecate the includeShadowRoots argument on DOMParserThe includeShadowRoots argument was a never-standardized argument to the DOMParser.parseFromString() function, which was there to allow imperative parsing of HTML content that contains declarative shadow DOM. This was shipped inChrome 90as part of the initial shipment of declarative shadow DOM. Since the standards discussion rematerialized in 2023, the shape of DSD APIs changed, including this feature for imperative parsing. To read more, see details of thecontext on the related standards, and information is also available on the related deprecations ofshadow DOM serializationandshadow root attribute.Now that a standardized version of this API, in the form ofsetHTMLUnsafe() and parseHTMLUnsafe()shipped in Chrome 124, the non-standard includeShadowRoots argument needs to be deprecated and removed.

- Deprecation of non-standard declarative shadow DOM serializationThe prototype implementation, which was shipped in 2020 and then updated in 2023, contained a method called `getInnerHTML()` that could be used to serialize DOM trees containing shadow roots. That part of the prototype was not standardized with the rest of the declarative shadow DOM, and has only recently reached spec consensus (for details, seeGithub). As part of that consensus, the shape of the getInnerHTML API changed.This feature represents the deprecation of the previously shipped `getInnerHTML()` method. The replacement is called `getHTML()`, which shipped in Chrome 125. For details, see thisChromeStatus feature description.Chrome 129 on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android

- Automatic reload of sign-in screenStarting from version 129, ChromeOS optimizes the support of 3P identity provider based logins. In the most common scenario, administrators show a permanent 3P identity provider login on the sign in screen. Many identity providers time out after a specific cadence, for example, 15 mins, leading to errors for the user. The newDeviceAuthenticationFlowAutoReloadIntervalpolicy allows for a repeated refresh of 3P identity providers on the login screen, avoids timeouts, and therefore significantly increases the reliability of 3P identity provider logins.

- Keyboard-focusable scroll containersImproves accessibility by making scroll containers focusable using sequential focus navigation. Today, the tab key doesn't focus scrollers unless tabIndex is explicitly set to 0 or more.By making scrollers focusable by default, users who can't (or don't want to) use a mouse will be able to focus clipped content using a keyboard's tab and arrow keys. This behavior is enabled only if the scroller does not contain any keyboard focusable children. This logic is necessary so we don't cause regressions for existing focusable elements that might exist within a scroller like a <textarea>.Chrome 130 on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android

- User Link capturing on PWAsWeb links automatically direct users to installed web apps. To better align with users' expectations around installed web apps, Chrome makes it easier to move between the browser and installed web apps.

Web links automatically direct users to installed web apps. To better align with users' expectations around installed web apps, Chrome makes it easier to move between the browser and installed web apps. When the user clicks a link that could be handled by an installed web app, Chrome adds a chip in the address bar to suggest switching over to the app. When the user clicks the chip, this either launches the app directly, or opens a grid of apps that can support that link.

- Chrome Third-Party Cookie Deprecation (3PCD)On July 22nd, we announced a new path forward for Privacy Sandbox on the web. Instead of deprecating third-party cookies, we would introduce a new experience in Chrome that lets people make an informed choice that applies across their web browsing, and they’d be able to adjust that choice at any time. We're discussing this new path with regulators, and will engage with the industry as we roll this out.For more details, see thisPrivacy Sandbox update.

- X25519Kyber768 key encapsulation for TLSStarting in Chrome 124, Chrome enables by default on all desktop platforms a new post-quantum secure TLS key encapsulation mechanism X25519Kyber768, based on a NIST standard (ML-KEM). This protects network traffic from Chrome with servers that also support ML-KEM from decryption by a future quantum computer. This is exposed as a new TLS cipher suite. TLS automatically negotiates supported ciphers, so this change should be transparent to server operators. This cipher will be used for both TLS 1.3 and QUIC connections.However, some enterprise network devices such as firewalls and proxies (TLS middleboxes) might be unprepared for the size of a Kyber (ML-KEM) key encapsulation, or a new TLS ClientHello cipher code point, leading to dropped or hanging connections. This can be resolved by updating your middlebox, or disabling the key encapsulation mechanism via the temporaryPostQuantumKeyAgreementEnabledenterprise policy, which will be available through at least Chrome 141 in 2025. However, long term, post-quantum secure ciphers will be required in TLS and the enterprise policy will be removed. Post-quantum cryptography is required for CSNA 2.0.Starting in Chrome 131, Chrome will switch the key encapsulation mechanism from the draft version of Kyber, to the final standard version of ML-KEM. Using any form of post-quantum key exchange (Kyber or ML-KEM) will continue to be controlled by thePostQuantumKeyAgreementEnabledpolicy.For more detail, see thisChromium blogpost and thisGoogle Security blogpost.Chrome 124 on Windows, macOS, LinuxChrome 131

- UI Automation accessibility framework provider on WindowsStarting in Chrome 126, Chrome will start directly supporting accessibility client software that uses Microsoft Windows's UI Automation accessibility framework. Prior to this change, such software interoperated with Chrome by way of a compatibility shim in Microsoft Windows. This change is being made to improve the accessible user experience for many users. It provides complete support for Narrator, Magnifier, and Voice Access; and will improve third-party apps that use Windows's UI Automation accessibility framework. Users of Chrome will find reduced memory usage and processing overhead when used with accessibility tools. It will also ease development of software using assistive technologies.Administrators can use theUiAutomationProviderEnabledenterprise policy, available from Chrome 125, to either force-enable the new provider (so that all users receive the new functionality), or disable the new provider. This policy will be supported through Chrome 136, and will be removed in Chrome 137.

- Rust JSON ParserAs early as Chrome 128, Chrome will parse JSON using Rust, rather than C++. This will remove the risk of memory safety vulnerabilities in the JSON parser, improving security. This change should be transparent to users. There is a small risk of certain invalid JSON, which Chrome currently accepts, no longer being accepted, although the Rust parser remains extremely lenient.In the event that Chrome doesn't accept the invalid JSON, this will lead to 500s or other application-level errors, not crashes. If Chrome no longer accepts some invalid JSON, the JSON should be aimed to be fixed.Chrome 128

- Updates for CookiePartitionKey of partitioned cookiesChrome 128 adds a cross-site ancestor bit to the keying of the partitioned cookie's CookiePartitionKey. This change unifies the partition key with the partition key values used in storage partitioning and adds protection against clickjacking attacks by preventing cross-site embedded frames from having access to the top-level-site's partitioned cookies.If an enterprise experiences any breakage with embedded iframes, they can use theCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicy or use SameSite=None cookies without the Partitioned attribute and then invoke the Storage Access API (SAA) to ensure that embedded iframes have access to the same cookies as the top level domain.Chrome 128 on Windows, Mac, Linux

- Deprecate CHIPS and relaunch in WebViewThe WebViewClient supports a method,shouldInterceptRequest, which allows developers to intercept network activity and modify HTTP headers, etc. This API does not have access to the Cookie header and relies on the Android CookieManager API in order to query what cookies are available for a particular request URL. However, partitioned cookies are double-keyed on the top-level site and the site of the URL using the cookies.Currently, the CookieManager API provides no way for developers to query partitioned cookies correctly, and this will cause a mismatch between what the Java API returns and what frames in WebView will actually be in their Cookie header. After discussing this with the WebView team, we believe that the option that will minimize potential app breakage is to disable Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State (CHIPS) on WebView until we are able to ship support for the Cookie header toshouldInterceptRequest. We will release the changes toshouldInterceptRequestin the next target SDK version (API level 36).Enterprise workflows that use WebView to load web content that relies on partitioned cookies will have their state cleared. WebView apps still have access to unpartitioned 3P cookies and cookies set with Partitioned after the change will revert to their legacy pre-CHIPS behavior until we relaunch the feature.Chrome 128 on Android

- New option in HttpsOnlyMode policyAsk Before HTTP (ABH) , formerly named HTTPS Only/First Modes, is a setting that tells Chrome to ask for user consent before sending insecure HTTP content over the wire. TheHttpsOnlyModepolicy allows force-enabling, or force-disabling, ABH.In Chrome 129, we are adding a new middle-ground variant of ABH calledbalanced mode. This variant aims to reduce user inconvenience by working like (strict) ABH most of the time, but not asking when Chrome knows that an HTTPS connection isn't possible, such as when connecting to a single-label hostname like internal/.We are adding aforce_balanced_enabledpolicy option to allow force-enabling this new variant. Settingforce_balanced_enabledon browsers before Chrome 129 will result in the default behavior, which places no enterprise restrictions on the ABH setting.To avoid unexpected impact, if you have previously setforce_enabled, we recommend not settingforce_balanced_enableduntil your entire fleet has upgraded to Chrome 129 or higher.

- Deprecate of non-standard declarative shadow DOM serializationThe prototype implementation, which was shipped in 2020 and then updated in 2023, contained a method called `getInnerHTML()` that could be used to serialize DOM trees containing shadow roots.

As part of that consensus, the shape of thegetInnerHTMLAPI changed.This feature represents the deprecation of the previously shipped `getInnerHTML()` method.

To read more, see details of thecontext on the related standards, and information is also available on the related deprecations ofshadow DOM serializationandshadow root attribute.Now that a standardized version of this API, in the form ofsetHTMLUnsafe() and parseHTMLUnsafe()shipped in Chrome 124, the non-standardincludeShadowRootsargument needs to be deprecated and removed. All usage should shift accordingly:Instead of:(new DOMParser()).parseFromString(html,'text/html',{includeShadowRoots: true});This can be used instead:document.parseHTMLUnsafe(html);

- Rename inset-area to position-areaThe CSS working group (CSSWG) resolved to rename this property from `inset-area` to `position-area`. See the CSSWG discussion inGithub.Chrome has decided to release an interoperable solution, by supporting both property names. We will ship the new property name, `position-area`, as a synonym for `inset-area` first. Then after a suitable amount of time, we will remove `inset-area`. The latter removal will be done under a separate Intent.Chrome 129 on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android

- Entrust certificate distrustIn response to sustained compliance failures, Chrome 127 changes how publicly-trusted TLS server authentication, that is, websites or certificates issued by Entrust, are trusted by default. This applies to Chrome 127 and later on Windows, macOS, ChromeOS, Android, and Linux; iOS policies do not allow use of the Chrome Root Store in Chrome for iOS.Specifically, TLS certificates validating to the Entrust root CA certificates included in the Chrome Root Store and issued:- after October 31, 2024, will no longer be trusted by default.- on or before October 31, 2024, will be unaffected by this change.If a Chrome user or an enterprise explicitly trusts any of the affected Entrust certificates on a platform and version of Chrome relying on the Chrome Root Store, for example, when explicit trust is conveyed through a Windows Group Policy Object, the Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT) constraints described above will be overridden and certificates will function as they do today.For additional information and testing resources, seeSustaining Digital Certificate Security - Entrust Certificate Distrust.To learn more about the Chrome Root Store, see thisFAQ.Chrome 127 on Android, ChromeOS, Linux, Mac, Windows: All versions of Chrome 127 and higher that rely on the Chrome Root Store will honor the blocking action, but the blocking action will only begin for certificates issued after October 31, 2024.Chrome 130 on ChromeOS, Linux, Mac, Windows:The blocking action will begin for certificates issued after October 31, 2024.

- Chrome Third-Party Cookie Deprecation (3PCD)On July 22nd, we announced a new path forward for Privacy Sandbox on the web. Instead of deprecating third-party cookies, we would introduce a new experience in Chrome that lets people make an informed choice that applies across their web browsing, and they’d be able to adjust that choice at any time. We're discussing this new path with regulators, and will engage with the industry as we roll this out.For more details, see thisPrivacy Sandbox update.

- User Link capturing on PWAsWeb links automatically direct users to installed web apps. To better align with users' expectations around installed web apps, Chrome makes it easier to move between the browser and installed web apps. When the user clicks a link that could be handled by an installed web app, Chrome adds a chip in the address bar to suggest switching over to the app. When the user clicks the chip, this either launches the app directly, or opens a grid of apps that can support that link. For some users, clicking a link always automatically opens the app.Chrome 121 on Linux, Mac, Windows: When some users click a link, it always opens in an installed PWA, while some users see the link open in a new tab with a chip in the address bar, clicking on which will launch the app. A flag is available to control this feature: chrome://flags/#enable-user-link-capturing-pwa.Chrome 130 on Linux, Mac, Windows:Launch to 100% of Stable with either a default on (always launch apps on link clicks) or a default off (always open in a tab, only launch if the user clicks on chip on address bar).

- X25519Kyber768 key encapsulation for TLSStarting in Chrome 124, Chrome enables by default on all desktop platforms a new post-quantum secure TLS key encapsulation mechanism X25519Kyber768, based on a NIST standard (ML-KEM). This protects network traffic from Chrome with servers that also support ML-KEM from decryption by a future quantum computer. This is exposed as a new TLS cipher suite. TLS automatically negotiates supported ciphers, so this change should be transparent to server operators. This cipher will be used for both TLS 1.3 and QUIC connections.However, some TLS middleboxes might be unprepared for the size of a Kyber (ML-KEM) key encapsulation, or a new TLS ClientHello cipher code point, leading to dropped or hanging connections. This can be resolved by updating your middlebox, or disabling the key encapsulation mechanism via the temporaryPostQuantumKeyAgreementEnabledenterprise policy, which will be available through the end of 2024. However, long term, post-quantum secure ciphers will be required in TLS and the enterprise policy will be removed. Post-quantum cryptography is required for CSNA 2.0.For more detail, see thisChromium blogpost.Chrome 124 on Windows, Mac, LinuxChrome 135 on Android

- UI Automation accessibility framework provider on WindowsStarting in Chrome 126, Chrome will start directly supporting accessibility client software that uses Microsoft Windows's UI Automation accessibility framework. Prior to this change, such software interoperated with Chrome by way of a compatibility shim in Microsoft Windows. This change is being made to improve the accessible user experience for many users. It provides complete support for Narrator, Magnifier, and Voice Access; and will improve third-party apps that use Windows's UI Automation accessibility framework. Users of Chrome will find reduced memory usage and processing overhead when used with accessibility tools. It will also ease development of software using assistive technologies.Administrators might use theUiAutomationProviderEnabledenterprise policy, available from Chrome 125, to either force-enable the new provider (so that all users receive the new functionality), or disable the new provider. This policy will be supported through Chrome 136, and will be removed in Chrome 137.

- App-bound encryption for cookiesTo improve the security of cookies on Windows, the encryption key used for cookie encryption will be further secured by binding it to Chrome's application identity. This can help protect against malware running at the same privilege as Chrome that might attempt to steal cookies from the system. This does not protect against an attacker who is able to elevate privilege or inject into Chrome's processes.App-bound Encryption strongly binds encryption keys to the local machine so customers who are using Chrome with roaming profiles may want to consider disabling this security feature otherwise cookies will not be portable between workstations.An enterprise policy,ApplicationBoundEncryptionEnabled, is available to disable application-bound encryption.Chrome 127 on Windows

- Migrate extensions to Manifest V3 before June 2025Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3. Chrome extensions are transitioning to a new manifest version, Manifest V3. This will bring improved privacy for your users—for example, by moving to a model where extensions modify requests declaratively, without the ability to see individual requests. This also improves extension security, as remotely hosted code will be disallowed on Manifest V3. Beginning June 2024, starting with Chrome 127 pre-stable versions, Chrome begins to gradually disable Manifest V2 extensions running in the browser.You can use theExtensionManifestV2Availabilitypolicy to test Manifest V3 in your organization ahead of the migration. Additionally, machines on which the policy is enabled will not be subject to the disabling of Manifest V2 extensions until the following year - June 2025 - at which point the policy will be removed.You can see which Manifest version is being used by all Chrome extensions running on your fleet using theApps & extensions usagepage in Chrome Enterprise Core.

- Deprecate mutation eventsSynchronous mutation events, includingDOMSubtreeModified,DOMNodeInserted,DOMNodeRemoved,DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument,DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument, andDOMCharacterDataModified, negatively affect page performance, and also significantly increase the complexity of adding new features to the Web.

Usage of the obsolete mutation events must be removed or migrated to Mutation Observer. In Chrome 124, a temporary enterprise policy,MutationEventsEnabled, was introduced to re-enable deprecated or removed mutation events.Starting in Chrome 127, mutation event support is disabled by default , from around July 30, 2024. Code should be migrated before that date to avoid site breakage.

- Keyboard-focusable scroll containersChrome 127 improves accessibility by making scroll containers focusable using sequential focus navigation.In previous releases, the tab key did not focus scrollers unless tabIndex was explicitly set to 0 or more.By making scrollers focusable by default, users who can't (or don't want to) use a mouse can now focus clipped content using keyboard tab and arrow keys. This behavior is enabled only if the scroller does not contain any keyboard focusable children. This logic is necessary so we don't cause regressions for existing focusable elements that might exist within a scroller like a <textarea>.Chrome 127 on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android

- Rust JSON parserAs early as Chrome 128, Chrome will parse JSON using Rust, rather than C++. This will remove the risk of memory safety vulnerabilities in the JSON parser, improving security. This change should be transparent to users. There is a small risk that some invalid JSON (which Chrome currently accepts) no longer being accepted, although the Rust parser remains extremely lenient.Earliest Chrome 128:Chrome will parse JSON using Rust

- Attribution tags for Search EngineAs part of our Digital Markets Act (DMA) compliance, Google is introducing choice screens for users to choose their default search engine within Chrome. The choice from the prompt controls the default search engine setting, currently available atchrome://settings/search.Selections from this screen will have their search URL appended with an attribution tag for use by third party search engines to attribute traffic from selections originating from the search engine choice screen. This change will not be applied for Education-configured organizations or Enterprises with metrics or usage statistics turned off.For enterprises that have chosen to have their administrator set their enterprise users’ search settings using the enterprise policiesDefaultSearchProviderEnabledandDefaultSearchProviderSearchUrl, those policies continue to control their enterprise search settings. Where the administrator has not set their enterprise users’ search settings by policy, enterprise users might see a prompt to choose their default search engine within Chrome.Read more about these policies and therelated atomic group.Chrome 128 on Android, iOS, ChromeOS, LaCrOS, Linux, Mac, Windows

- Cross-site ancestor chain bit for CookiePartitionKey of partitioned cookiesChrome 128 adds a cross-site ancestor bit to the keying of the partitioned cookie's CookiePartitionKey. This change unifies the partition key with the partition key values used in storage partitioning and adds protection against clickjacking attacks by preventing cross-site embedded frames from having access to the top-level-site's partitioned cookies.If an enterprise experiences any breakage with embedded iframes, they can use theCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicy or useSameSite=Nonecookies without the Partitioned attribute and then invoke the Storage Access API (SAA) to ensure that embedded iframes have access to the same cookies as the top level domain.Chrome 128 on Windows, Mac, Linux

- Ad-hoc code signatures for PWA shims on macOSCode signatures for the application shims that are created when installing a Progressive Web App (PWA) on macOS are changing to use ad-hoc code signatures that are created when the application is installed. The code signature is used by macOS as part of the application's identity. These ad-hoc signatures will result in each PWA shim having a unique identity to macOS; currently every PWA looks like the same application to macOS.This will address problems when attempting to include multiple PWAs in the macOSOpen at Loginpreference pane, and will permit future improvements for handling user notifications within PWAs on macOS.Chrome 129 on Mac

- Deprecation of non-standard declarative shadow DOM serializationThe prototype implementation, which was shipped in 2020 and then updated in 2023, contained a method called `getInnerHTML()` that could be used to serialize DOM trees containing shadow roots. That part of the prototype was not standardized with the rest of declarative shadow DOM, and has only recently reached spec consensus (for details, seeGithub). As part of that consensus, the shape of the getInnerHTML API changed.This feature represents the deprecation of the previously shipped `getInnerHTML()` method. The replacement is called `getHTML()`, which shipped in Chrome 125. For details, see thisChromeStatus feature description.Chrome 129 on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android

- Third-party cookie access in ChromeOn 22 July 2024, we announced a new path forward for the Privacy Sandbox on the web. Instead of deprecating third-party cookies, we plan to introduce a new experience in Chrome that lets people make an informed choice that applies across their web browsing. They would be able to adjust that choice at any time. We're discussing this new path with regulators, and will engage with the industry as we roll this out.For more details, see thisPrivacy Sandbox update.

- User Link capturing on PWAsWeb links automatically direct users to installed web apps. To better align with users' expectations around installed web apps, Chrome makes it easier to move between the browser and installed web apps. When the user clicks a link that could be handled by an installed web app, Chrome adds a chip in the address bar to suggest switching over to the app. When the user clicks the chip, this either launches the app directly, or opens a grid of apps that can support that link. For some users, clicking a link always automatically opens the app.Chrome 121 on Linux, Mac, Windows: When some users click a link, it always opens in an installed PWA, while some users see the link open in a new tab with a chip in the address bar, clicking on which will launch the app. A flag is available to control this feature: chrome://flags/#enable-user-link-capturing-pwa.Chrome 130 on Linux, Mac, Windows:Launch to 100% of Stable with either a default on (always launch apps on link clicks) or a default off (always open in a tab, only launch if the user clicks on chip on address bar).

- Private network access checks for navigation requests: warning-only modeBefore a website A navigates to another site B in the user's private network, this feature does the following:1. Checks whether the request has been initiated from a secure context.2. Sends a preflight request, and checks whether B responds with a header that allows private network access.There are already features for subresources and workers, but this one is for navigation requests specifically. These checks protect the user's private network.Since this feature is thewarning-onlymode, we do not fail the requests if any of the checks fail.

- X25519Kyber768 key encapsulation for TLSStarting in Chrome 124, Chrome enables by default on all desktop platforms a new post-quantum secure TLS key encapsulation mechanism X25519Kyber768, based on a NIST standard (ML-KEM). This protects network traffic from Chrome with servers that also support ML-KEM from decryption by a future quantum computer. This is exposed as a new TLS cipher suite. TLS automatically negotiates supported ciphers, so this change should be transparent to server operators. This cipher will be used for both TLS 1.3 and QUIC connections.However, some TLS middleboxes might be unprepared for the size of a Kyber (ML-KEM) key encapsulation, or a new TLS ClientHello cipher code point, leading to dropped or hanging connections. This can be resolved by updating your middlebox, or disabling the key encapsulation mechanism via the temporaryPostQuantumKeyAgreementEnabledenterprise policy, which will be available through the end of 2024. However, long term, post-quantum secure ciphers will be required in TLS and the enterprise policy will be removed.

- Chrome Third-Party Cookie Deprecation (3PCD)Third party cookies will be restricted in a future release of Chrome. Currently, they are restricted by default for 1% of Chrome users to allow sites to preview the user experience without third-party cookies. Most enterprises are excluded from this group automatically and admins can use theBlockThirdPartyCookiesandCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicies to re-enable third-party cookies if needed.End users can use theeye iconin the omnibox to temporarily re-enable third-party cookies for 90 days on a given site when necessary. Seethis help articlefor more details on how to toggle these settings for the desired configuration.Bounce tracking protectionsare enforced when the bouncing site is not permitted to use 3P cookies, and are controllable with the same policies.

- UI Automation accessibility framework provider on WindowsStarting in Chrome 126, Chrome starts to directly support accessibility client software that uses Microsoft Windows's UI Automation accessibility framework. Prior to this change, such software interoperated with Chrome using a compatibility shim in Microsoft Windows. This change improves the user experience for many users. It provides complete support for Narrator, Magnifier, and Voice Access; and it improves third-party apps that use Windows's UI Automation accessibility framework. Chrome users now find reduced memory usage and processing overhead when using accessibility tools. It also eases development of software using assistive technologies.Administrators can use theUiAutomationProviderEnabledenterprise policy, introduced in Chrome 125, to either force-enable the new provider (so that all users receive the new functionality), or disable the new provider. This policy will be supported through Chrome 136, and will be removed in Chrome 137. This one-year period is intended to give enterprises sufficient time to work with third-party vendors so that they can fix any incompatibilities resulting from the switch from Microsoft's compatibility shim to Chrome's UI Automation provider.Chrome 125 on Windows: TheUiAutomationProviderEnabledpolicy is introduced so that administrators can enable Chrome's UI Automation accessibility framework provider and validate that third-party accessibility tools continue to work.Chrome 126 on Windows:The Chrome variations framework will be used to begin enabling Chrome's UI Automation accessibility framework provider for users. It will be progressively enabled to the full stable population, with pauses as needed to address compatibility issues that can be resolved in Chrome. Enterprise administrators may continue to use theUiAutomationProviderEnabledpolicy to either opt-in early to the new behavior, or to temporarily opt-out through Chrome 136.Chrome 137 on Windows: TheUiAutomationProviderEnabledpolicy will be removed from Chrome.

- Captive portal for managed networksGiven that captive portal detection is always disabled for managed networks, administrators are unable to configure the ChromeOS device to auto connect to captive portal networks or to detect that the captive portal exists. If they do make the captive portal network managed, users have to manually open a browser and connect to an HTTP site that can then be redirected to a portal sign in page. We’ve added a new policy,CaptivePortalAuthenticationIgnoresProxy, which allows admins to force portal detection.

- Entrust certificate distrustIn response to sustained compliance failures, Chrome is changing how publicly-trusted TLS server authentication, that is, website, certificates issued by Entrust will be trusted by default in Chrome 127 and greater on Windows, macOS, ChromeOS, Android, and Linux.  iOS policies do not allow use of the Chrome Root Store in Chrome for iOS.Specifically:- TLS certificates validating to the Entrust root CA certificates included in the Chrome Root Store and issued:- after October 31, 2024, will no longer be trusted by default.- on or before October 31, 2024, will be unaffected by this change.Should a Chrome user or enterprise explicitly trust any of the affected Entrust certificates on a platform and version of Chrome relying on the Chrome Root Store, for example, explicit trust is conveyed through a Windows Group Policy Object, the SCT-based constraints described above will be overridden and certificates will function as they do today.For additional information and testing resources, seeSustaining Digital Certificate Security - Entrust Certificate Distrust.To learn more about the Chrome Root Store, see thisFAQ.Chrome 127 on Android, ChromeOS, Linux, Mac, Windows:All versions of Chrome 127 and higher that rely on the Chrome Root Store will honor the blocking action, but the blocking action will only begin for certificates issued after October 31, 2024.Chrome 130 on ChromeOS, Linux, Mac, Windows: The blocking action will begin for certificates issued after October 31, 2024.

- App-bound encryption for cookiesTo improve the security of cookies on Windows, the encryption key used for cookie encryption will be further secured by binding it to Chrome's application identity. This can help protect against malware that might attempt to steal cookies from the system. This does not protect against an attacker who is able to elevate privilege or inject into Chrome's processes.An enterprise policy,ApplicationBoundEncryptionEnabled, is available to disable application-bound encryption.Chrome 127 on Windows

- Migrate extensions to Manifest V3 before June 2025Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3. Chrome extensions are transitioning to a new manifest version, Manifest V3. This will bring improved privacy for your users—for example, by moving to a model where extensions modify requests declaratively, without the ability to see individual requests. This also improves extension security, as remotely hosted code will be disallowed on Manifest V3. Beginning June 2024, starting with Chrome 127 pre-stable versions, Chrome will gradually disable Manifest V2 extensions running in the browser. An enterprise policy,ExtensionManifestV2Availability, can be used to test Manifest V3 in your organization ahead of the migration. Additionally, machines on which the policy is enabled will not be subject to the disabling of Manifest V2 extensions until the following year, June 2025, at which point the policy will be removed.You can see which Manifest version is being used by all Chrome extensions running on your fleet using theApps & extensions usagepage in Chrome Enterprise Core. Read more on theManifest timeline, including:Chrome 127 on ChromeOS, LaCrOS, Linux, Mac, Windows:Chrome will gradually disable Manifest V2 extensions on user devices.

- Network Service on Windows will be sandboxedTo improve security and reliability, the network service, already running in its own process, will be sandboxed on Windows. As part of this, third-party code that is currently able to tamper with the network service may be prevented from doing so. This might cause interoperability issues with software that injects code into Chrome's process space, such as Data Loss Prevention software. TheNetworkServiceSandboxEnabledpolicy allows you to disable the sandbox if incompatibilities are discovered. You can test the sandbox in your environment usingtheseinstructions. You canreportany issues you encounter.Chrome 127 on Windows:Network Service sandboxed on Windows

- Simplified sign-in and sync experience on AndroidChrome will launch a simplified and consolidated version of sign-in and sync in Chrome on Android. Chrome sync will no longer be shown as a separate feature in settings or elsewhere. Instead, users can sign in to Chrome to use and save information like passwords, bookmarks and more in their Google Account, subject to the relevant enterprise policies.As before, the functionality previously part of Chrome sync that saves and accesses Chrome data in the Google Account can be turned off viaSyncTypesListDisabled. Sign-in to Chrome can be disabled viaBrowserSigninas before.Note that the changes do not affect users’ ability to sign in to Google services on the web (like Gmail) without signing in to Chrome, their ability to stay signed out of Chrome, or their ability to control what information is synced with their Google Account.The changes are virtually identical to the simplified sign-in and sync experience launched on iOS in 117.Chrome 127 on Android

- Deprecate mutation eventsSynchronous mutation events, includingDOMSubtreeModified,DOMNodeInserted,DOMNodeRemoved,DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument,DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument, andDOMCharacterDataModified, negatively affect page performance, and also significantly increase the complexity of adding new features to the Web. These APIs were deprecated from the spec in 2011, and were replaced (in 2012) by the much better-behaved Mutation Observer API. Usage of the obsolete mutation events must be removed or migrated to Mutation Observer. Starting in Chrome 124, a temporary enterprise policy,MutationEventsEnabled, will be available to re-enable deprecated or removed mutation events. If you encounter any issues, file a bughere.Mutation event support will be disabled by default starting in Chrome 127, around July 30, 2024. Code should be migrated before that date to avoid site breakage.

- Ad-hoc code signatures for PWA shims on macOSCode signatures for the application shims that are created when installing a Progressive Web App (PWA) on macOS are changing to use ad-hoc code signatures that are created when the application is installed. The code signature is used by macOS as part of the application's identity. These ad-hoc signatures will result in each PWA shim having a unique identity to macOS; currently every PWA looks like the same application to macOS.This will address problems when attempting to include multiple PWAs in the macOSOpen at Loginpreference pane, and will permit future improvements for handling user notifications within PWAs on macOS.Chrome 128 on Mac

These checks protect the user's private network. Since this feature is thewarning-onlymode, we do not fail the requests if any of the checks fail. Instead, a warning will be shown in the DevTools, to help developers prepare for the coming enforcement.

- X25519Kyber768 key encapsulation for TLSStarting in Chrome 124, Chrome enables by default on all desktop platforms a new post-quantum secure TLS key encapsulation mechanism X25519Kyber768, based on a NIST standard (ML-KEM). This protects network traffic from Chrome with servers that also support ML-KEM from decryption by a future quantum computer. This is exposed as a new TLS cipher suite. TLS automatically negotiates supported ciphers, so this change should be transparent to server operators. This cipher will be used for both TLS 1.3 and QUIC connections.However, some TLS middleboxes might be unprepared for the size of a Kyber (ML-KEM) key encapsulation, or a new TLS ClientHello cipher code point, leading to dropped or hanging connections. This can be resolved by updating your middlebox, or disabling the key encapsulation mechanism via the temporaryPostQuantumKeyAgreementEnabledenterprise policy, which will be available through the end of 2024. However, long term, post-quantum secure ciphers will be required in TLS and the enterprise policy will be removed. Post-quantum cryptography is required for CSNA 2.0.Please seethisblog post for more detail.Chrome 124 on Windows, Mac, LinuxChrome 135 on Android

- Automatic deep file scanning for Enhanced Safe Browsing usersDeep scanning of downloads for Enhanced Safe Browsing users has been launched since Chrome 91. At that time, users had to consent to each file they wanted deep-scanned automatically. Starting in Chrome 125, users no longer have to do that. Deep scanning is performed automatically as part of the improved protections offered by Enhanced Safe Browsing. Admins wishing to disable this feature can ensure their users are not in Enhanced Safe Browsing mode at all with theSafeBrowsingProtectionLevelpolicy, or disable deep scans withSafeBrowsingDeepScanningEnabled.Chrome 125 on LaCrOS, Linux, Mac, Windows:Feature rolls out

- Send download reports without explicit user decisionThe Client Safe Browsing Report is a telemetry report sent to Safe Browsing when a warning is shown in Chrome. Today, download reports are sent when users discard or bypass a download warning. Based on the learnings from the initial tailored warning experiment, many download warnings are not explicitly discarded or bypassed. Reports are not sent for these warnings, so Safe Browsing doesn't have visibility on the effectiveness of these warnings. This feature aims to close this telemetry gap by sending reports when the download is auto-discarded or the browser is closed.Chrome 125 on ChromeOS, LaCrOS, Linux, Mac, Windows

- UI Automation accessibility framework provider on WindowsStarting in Chrome 126, Chrome will start directly supporting accessibility client software that uses Microsoft Windows's UI Automation accessibility framework. Prior to this change, such software interoperated with Chrome by way of a compatibility shim in Microsoft Windows. This change is being made to improve the accessible user experience for many users. It provides complete support for Narrator, Magnifier, and Voice Access; and will improve third-party apps that use Windows's UI Automation accessibility framework. Users of Chrome will find reduced memory usage and processing overhead when used with accessibility tools. It will also ease development of software using assistive technologies.Starting in Chrome 125, administrators can use theUiAutomationProviderEnabledenterprise policy to either force-enable the new provider (so that all users receive the new functionality), or disable the new provider. This policy will be supported through Chrome 136, and will be removed in Chrome 137. This one-year period is intended to give enterprises sufficient time to work with third-party vendors so that they may fix any incompatibilities resulting from the switch from Microsoft's compatibility shim to Chrome's UI Automation provider.Chrome 125 on Windows:TheUiAutomationProviderEnabledpolicy is introduced so that administrators can enable Chrome's UI Automation accessibility framework provider and validate that third-party accessibility tools continue to work.Chrome 126 on Windows: The Chrome variations framework will be used to begin enabling Chrome's UI Automation accessibility framework provider for users.

- Extending Storage Access API (SAA) to non-cookie storageChrome extends the Storage Access API to allow access to unpartitioned cookie and non-cookie storage in a third-party context. The current API only provides access to cookies, which have different use-cases than non-cookie storage. The API can be used as follows (JS running in an embedded iframe):// Request a new storage handle via rSA (this should prompt the user)let handle = await document.requestStorageAccess({all: true});// Write some cross-site localstoragehandle.localStorage.setItem("userid", "1234");// Open or create an indexedDB that is shared with the 1P contextlet messageDB = handle.defaultBucket.indexedDB.open("messages");The same flow would be used by iframes to get a storage handle when their top-level ancestor successfully calledrSAFor, just that in this case thestorage-accesspermission was already granted and thus therSAcall would not require a user gesture or show a prompt, allowing for hidden iframes accessing storage.Chrome 125 on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android

// Open or create an indexedDB that is shared with the 1P contextlet messageDB = handle.defaultBucket.indexedDB.open("messages");


The same flow would be used by iframes to get a storage handle when their top-level ancestor successfully calledrSAFor, just that in this case thestorage-accesspermission was already granted and thus therSAcall would not require a user gesture or show a prompt, allowing for hidden iframes accessing storage.

- Inactive browser deletion in Chrome Enterprise CoreStarting in April 2024 until June 2024, theInactive period for browser deletion policyhas started to roll out and automatically delete enrolled browsers in the Admin console that have been inactive for more than the inactivity period of time determined by the policy. When releasing the policy, the inactivity period of time has a default value of 540 days. Meaning that by default, all enrolled browsers that have been inactive for more than 540 days are deleted from your account. Administrators can change the inactive period value using this policy. The maximum value to determine the browser inactivity period is 730 days and the minimum value is 28 days (learn more).If you lower the set policy value, it might have a global impact on any currently enrolled browsers. All impacted browsers will be considered inactive and, therefore, beirreversibly deleted. To ensure the deleted browsers re-enroll automatically next time they restart, set theDevice Token Managementpolicy value toDelete tokenbefore lowering the value of this policy. The enrollment tokens on these browsers need to still be valid at the time of the restart.

- Cross-site ancestor chain bit for CookiePartitionKey of partitioned cookiesChrome 125 adds a cross-site ancestor bit to the keying of the partitioned cookie's CookiePartitionKey. This change unifies the partition key with the partition key values used in storage partitioning and adds protection against clickjacking attacks by preventing cross-site embedded frames from having access to the top-level-site's partitioned cookies.If an enterprise experiences any breakage with embedded iframes, they can use theCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicy or use SameSite=None cookies without the Partitioned attribute and then invoke the Storage Access API (SAA) or use the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to ensure that embedded iframes have access to the same cookies as the top level domain.Chrome 126 on Windows, Mac, Linux

- All extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3 by June 2025Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3. Chrome extensions are transitioning to a new manifest version, Manifest V3. This will bring improved privacy for your users—for example, by moving to a model where extensions modify requests declaratively, without the ability to see individual requests. This also improves extension security, as remotely hosted code will be disallowed on Manifest V3.Beginning June 2024, Chrome will gradually disable Manifest V2 extensions running in the browser. An Enterprise policy -ExtensionManifestV2Availability- is available to control whether Manifest v2 extensions are allowed. The policy can be used to test Manifest V3 in your organization ahead of the migration. Additionally, machines on which the policy is enabled will not be subject to the disabling of Manifest V2 extensions until the following year - June 2025 - at which point the policy will be removed.You can see which Manifest version is being used by all Chrome extensions running on your fleet using theApps & extensions usagepage inChrome Enterprise Core.

Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3. Chrome extensions are transitioning to a new manifest version, Manifest V3. This will bring improved privacy for your users—for example, by moving to a model where extensions modify requests declaratively, without the ability to see individual requests. This also improves extension security, as remotely hosted code will be disallowed on Manifest V3.


Beginning June 2024, Chrome will gradually disable Manifest V2 extensions running in the browser. An Enterprise policy -ExtensionManifestV2Availability- is available to control whether Manifest v2 extensions are allowed. The policy can be used to test Manifest V3 in your organization ahead of the migration. Additionally, machines on which the policy is enabled will not be subject to the disabling of Manifest V2 extensions until the following year - June 2025 - at which point the policy will be removed.


You can see which Manifest version is being used by all Chrome extensions running on your fleet using theApps & extensions usagepage inChrome Enterprise Core. Read more on theManifest timeline, including:

- Simplified sign-in and sync experience on AndroidChrome will launch a simplified and consolidated version of sign-in and sync in Chrome on Android. Chrome sync will no longer be shown as a separate feature in settings or elsewhere. Instead, users can sign in to Chrome to use and save information like passwords, bookmarks and more in their Google Account, subject to the relevant enterprise policies.As before, the functionality previously part of Chrome sync that saves and accesses Chrome data in the Google Account can be turned off viaSyncTypesListDisabled. Sign-in to Chrome can be disabled viaBrowserSigninas before.Note that the changes do not affect users’ ability to sign in to Google services on the web (like Gmail) without signing in to Chrome, their ability to stay signed out of Chrome, or their ability to control what information is synced with their Google Account.The changes are virtually identical to the simplified sign-in and sync experience launched on iOS in 117.Chrome 127 on Android

- Intent to deprecate: mutation eventsSynchronous mutation events, includingDOMSubtreeModified,DOMNodeInserted,DOMNodeRemoved,DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument,DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument, andDOMCharacterDataModified, negatively affect page performance, and also significantly increase the complexity of adding new features to the Web. These APIs were deprecated from the spec in 2011, and were replaced (in 2012) by the much better-behaved Mutation Observer API. Usage of the obsolete mutation events must be removed or migrated to Mutation Observer. Starting in Chrome 124, a temporary enterprise policy,MutationEventsEnabled, will be available to re-enable deprecated or removed mutation events. If you encounter any issues, file a bughere.Mutation event support will be disabled by default starting in Chrome 127, around July 30, 2024. Code should be migrated before that date to avoid site breakage. If more time is needed, there are a few options:- TheMutation Events Deprecation Trialcan be used to re-enable the feature for a limited time on a given site.

- User link capturing on PWAsWeb links automatically direct users to installed web apps. To better align with users' expectations around installed web apps, Chrome makes it easier to move between the browser and installed web apps. When the user clicks a link that could be handled by an installed web app, Chrome adds a chip in the address bar to suggest switching over to the app. When the user clicks the chip, this either launches the app directly, or opens a grid of apps that can support that link. For some users, clicking a link always automatically opens the app.Chrome 121 on Linux, MacOS, Windows: When some users click a link, it always opens in an installed PWA, while some users see the link open in a new tab with a chip in the address bar, clicking on which will launch the app. A flag is available to control this feature:chrome://flags/#enable-user-link-capturing-pwa.Earliest in Chrome 127 on Linux, MacOS, Windows:We will launch to 100% of Stable with either a default on (always launch apps on link clicks) or a default off (always open in a tab, only launch if user clicks on chip on address bar).

- X25519Kyber768 key encapsulation for TLSStarting in Chrome 124, Chrome enables by default on all desktop platforms a new post-quantum secure TLS key encapsulation mechanism X25519Kyber768, based on a NIST standard (ML-KEM). This protects network traffic from Chrome with servers that also support ML-KEM from decryption by a future quantum computer. This is exposed as a new TLS cipher suite. TLS automatically negotiates supported ciphers, so this change should be transparent to server operators. This cipher will be used for both TLS 1.3 and QUIC connections.However, some TLS middleboxes might be unprepared for the size of a Kyber (ML-KEM) key encapsulation, or a new TLS ClientHello cipher code point, leading to dropped or hanging connections. This can be resolved by updating your middlebox, or disabling the key encapsulation mechanism via the temporaryPostQuantumKeyAgreementEnabledenterprise policy, which will be available through the end of 2024. However, long term, post-quantum secure ciphers will be required in TLS and the enterprise policy will be removed. Post-quantum cryptography is required for CSNA 2.0.Please seethisblog post for more detail.Chrome 124 on Windows, Mac, LinuxChrome 128 on Android

- Chrome Third-Party Cookie Deprecation (3PCD)Aspreviously announced, Chrome 120 started to restrict third-party cookies by default for 1% of Chrome users to facilitate testing, and subsequent releases will ramp up to 100% of users as early as Q3 2024. The ramp up to 100% of users is subject to addressing any remaining competition concerns of theUK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Browsers that are part of the 1% experiment group also see new Tracking Protection user controls. You can try out these changes in Chrome 120 or higher by enablingchrome://flags/#test-third-party-cookie-phaseout.This testing period allows sites to meaningfully preview what it's like to operate in a world without third-party cookies. Asbounce-tracking protectionsare also a part of 3PCD, the users in this group with third-party cookies blocked have bounce tracking mitigations taking effect, so that their state is cleared for sites that get classified as bounce trackers. Most enterprise users are excluded from this 1% experiment group automatically; however, we recommend that admins proactively use theBlockThirdPartyCookiesandCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicies to re-enable third-party cookies and opt out managed browsers ahead of the experiment. This gives enterprises time to make the changes required to avoid relying on this policy or on third-party cookies.We are launching theLegacy Technology Reportto help identify third-party cookies use cases. Admins can set theBlockThirdPartyCookies policytoFalseto re-enable third-party cookies for all sites but this prevents users from changing the corresponding setting in Chrome. Alternatively, to prevent breakage, you can set theCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicy to allowlist your enterprise applications to continue to receive third-party cookies.For enterprise end users that are pulled into this experiment group and that are not covered by either enterprise admin policy, they can use theeye iconin the omnibox to temporarily re-enable third-party cookies for 90 days on a given site, when necessary. Seethis help articlefor more details on how to toggle these settings for the desired configuration.Bounce tracking protectionsare also covered by the same policies as cookies and these protections are enforced when the bouncing site is not permitted to use 3P cookies. So setting theBlockThirdPartyCookiespolicy to false, or setting theCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicy for a site, prevents bounce tracking mitigations from deleting state for sites.Enterprise SaaS integrations used in a cross-site context for non-advertising use cases can register for thethird-party deprecation trialor thefirst-party deprecation trialfor continued access to third-party cookies for a limited period of time.Theheuristics featuregrants temporary third-party cookie access in limited scenarios based on user behavior. This mitigates site breakage caused by third-party cookie deprecation in established patterns, such as identity provider pop ups and redirects.For more details on how to prepare, provide feedback and report potential site issues, refer to our updated landing page onpreparing for the end of third-party cookies.Starting in Chrome 120 on ChromeOS, Linux, MacOS, Windows1% of global traffic has third-party cookies disabled. Enterprise users are excluded from this automatically where possible, and a policy is available to override the change.

Asbounce-tracking protectionsare also a part of 3PCD, the users in this group with third-party cookies blocked have bounce tracking mitigations taking effect, so that their state is cleared for sites that get classified as bounce trackers. Most enterprise users are excluded from this 1% experiment group automatically; however, we recommend that admins proactively use theBlockThirdPartyCookiesandCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicies to re-enable third-party cookies and opt out managed browsers ahead of the experiment. This gives enterprises time to make the changes required to avoid relying on this policy or on third-party cookies.


We are launching theLegacy Technology Reportto help identify third-party cookies use cases. Admins can set theBlockThirdPartyCookies policytoFalseto re-enable third-party cookies for all sites but this prevents users from changing the corresponding setting in Chrome. Alternatively, to prevent breakage, you can set theCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicy to allowlist your enterprise applications to continue to receive third-party cookies.


For enterprise end users that are pulled into this experiment group and that are not covered by either enterprise admin policy, they can use theeye iconin the omnibox to temporarily re-enable third-party cookies for 90 days on a given site, when necessary. Seethis help articlefor more details on how to toggle these settings for the desired configuration.


Bounce tracking protectionsare also covered by the same policies as cookies and these protections are enforced when the bouncing site is not permitted to use 3P cookies. So setting theBlockThirdPartyCookiespolicy to false, or setting theCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicy for a site, prevents bounce tracking mitigations from deleting state for sites.


Enterprise SaaS integrations used in a cross-site context for non-advertising use cases can register for thethird-party deprecation trialor thefirst-party deprecation trialfor continued access to third-party cookies for a limited period of time.


Theheuristics featuregrants temporary third-party cookie access in limited scenarios based on user behavior. This mitigates site breakage caused by third-party cookie deprecation in established patterns, such as identity provider pop ups and redirects.


For more details on how to prepare, provide feedback and report potential site issues, refer to our updated landing page onpreparing for the end of third-party cookies.


- Starting in Chrome 120 on ChromeOS, Linux, MacOS, Windows1% of global traffic has third-party cookies disabled. Enterprise users are excluded from this automatically where possible, and a policy is available to override the change.





- Permissions prompt for Web MIDI APIThe Web MIDI API connects to and interacts with Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) Devices. There have beenseveral reported problemsaround Web MIDI API's drive-by access to client MIDI devices (see relatedChromium bug). To address this problem, the W3CAudio Working Groupdecided to place an explicit permission on generalWeb MIDI API access. Originally, the explicit permission was only required for advanced Web MIDI usage in Chrome, including the ability to send and receive system exclusive (SysEx) messages, with gated access behind a permissions prompt. We now intend to expand the scope of the permission to regular Web MIDI API usage.In Chrome 124, all access to the Web MIDI API requires a user permission. No policies are available to control these changes. If you encounter any issues, file a bughere.Chrome 124 on Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android

- X25519Kyber768 key encapsulation for TLSStarting in Chrome 124, Chrome enables by default on all desktop platforms a new post-quantum secure TLS key encapsulation mechanism X25519Kyber768, based on a NIST standard (ML-KEM). This is exposed as a new TLS cipher suite. TLS automatically negotiates supported ciphers, so this change should be transparent to server operators. However, some TLS middleboxes might be unprepared for the size of a Kyber (ML-KEM) key encapsulation, or a new TLS ClientHello cipher code point, leading to dropped or hanging connections. This can be resolved by updating your middlebox, or disabling the key encapsulation mechanism via the temporaryPostQuantumKeyAgreementEnabledenterprise policy, which will be available through the end of 2024. However, long term, post-quantum secure ciphers will be required in TLS and the enterprise policy will be removed. This cipher will be used for both TLS 1.3 and QUIC connections.Chrome 124 on Windows, MacOS, Linux

Meaning that by default, all enrolled browsers that have been inactive for more than 540 days will be deleted from your account. Administrators can change the inactive period value using this policy. The maximum value to determine the browser inactivity period will be 730 days and the minimum value is 28 days (learn more).If you lower the set policy value, it might have a global impact on any currently enrolled browsers. All impacted browsers will be considered inactive and, therefore, beirreversibly deleted. To ensure the deleted browsers re-enroll automatically next time they restart, set theDevice Token Managementpolicy value toDelete tokenbefore lowering the value of this policy. The enrollment tokens on these browsers need to still be valid at the time of the restart.


Inactive browser deletion in Chrome Enterprise Core


Starting in April 2024 until May 2024, forChrome Enterprise Core, theInactive period for browser deletion policywill start rolling out and automatically delete enrolled browsers in the Admin console that have been inactive for more than the inactivity period of time determined by the policy.

## Admin console updates

## Coming soon


Note:The items listed below are experimental or planned updates. They might change, be delayed, or canceled before launching to the Stable channel.






## Coming soon

#### Upcoming browser changes





- UI Automation accessibility framework provider on WindowsStarting in Chrome 126, Chrome will start directly supporting accessibility client software that uses Microsoft Windows' UI Automation accessibility framework. Prior to this change, such software interoperated with Chrome by way of a compatibility shim in Microsoft Windows. This change is being made to improve the accessible user experience for many users. It provides complete support for Narrator, Magnifier, and Voice Access; and will improve third-party apps that use Windows's UI Automation accessibility framework. Users of Chrome will find reduced memory usage and processing overhead when used with accessibility tools. It will also ease development of software using assistive technologies.Administrators may use theUiAutomationProviderEnabledenterprise policy starting in Chrome 125 to either force-enable the new provider (so that all users receive the new functionality), or disable the new provider. This policy will be supported through Chrome 136, and will be removed in Chrome 137. This one-year period is intended to give enterprises sufficient time to work with third-party vendors so that they may fix any incompatibilities resulting from the switch from Microsoft's compatibility shim to Chrome's UI Automation provider.Chrome 125 on Window:TheUiAutomationProviderEnabledpolicy is introduced so that administrators can enable Chrome's UI Automation accessibility framework provider and validate that third-party accessibility tools continue to work.Chrome 126 on Windows: The Chrome variations framework will be used to begin enabling Chrome's UI Automation accessibility framework provider for users. It will be progressively enabled to the full stable population, with pauses as needed to address compatibility issues that can be resolved in Chrome. Enterprise administrators may continue to use theUiAutomationProviderEnabledpolicy to either opt-in early to the new behavior, or to temporarily opt-out through Chrome 136.Chrome 137 on Windows: TheUiAutomationProviderEnabledpolicy will be removed from Chrome.

- Keyboard-focusable scroll containersMaking scroll containers focusable using sequential focus navigation greatly improves accessibility. Today, the tab key doesn't focus scrollers unlesstabIndexis explicitly set to 0 or more.By making scrollers focusable by default, users who can't (or don't want to) use a mouse will be able to focus clipped content using a keyboard's tab and arrow keys. This behavior is enabled only if the scroller does not contain any keyboard focusable children. This logic is necessary so we don't cause regressions for existing focusable elements that might exist within a scroller like a<textarea>.Chrome 125 on Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android

- Network Service on Windows will be sandboxedTo improve security and reliability, the network service, already running in its own process, will be sandboxed on Windows. As part of this, third-party code that is currently able to tamper with the network service may be prevented from doing so. This might cause interoperability issues with software that injects code into Chrome's process space, such as Data Loss Prevention software. TheNetworkServiceSandboxEnabledpolicy allows you to disable the sandbox if incompatibilities are discovered. You can test the sandbox in your environment usingtheseinstructions andreportany issues you encounter.Chrome 125 on Windows:Network Service sandboxed on Windows.

- Extending Storage Access API (SAA) to non-cookie storageWe propose an extension of the Storage Access API (backwards compatible) to allow access to unpartitioned (cookie and non-cookie) storage in a third-party context, and imagine the API mechanics to be roughly like this (JS running in an embedded iframe):// Request a new storage handle via rSA (this should prompt the user)let handle = await document.requestStorageAccess({all: true});// Write some cross-site localstoragehandle.localStorage.setItem("userid", "1234");// Open or create an indexedDB that is shared with the 1P contextlet messageDB = handle.defaultBucket.indexedDB.open("messages");The same flow would be used by iframes to get a storage handle when their top-level ancestor successfully calledrSAFor, just that in this case thestorage-accesspermission was already granted and thus therSAcall would not require a user gesture or show a prompt, allowing for hidden iframes accessing storage.

- Cross-site ancestor chain bit for CookiePartitionKey of partitioned cookiesChrome 125 adds a cross-site ancestor bit to the keying of the partitioned cookie'sCookiePartitionKey. This change unifies the partition key with the partition key values used in storage partitioning and adds protection against clickjacking attacks by preventing cross-site embedded frames from having access to the top-level-site's partitioned cookies.If an enterprise experiences any breakage with embedded iframes, they can use theCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicy or useSameSite=Nonecookieswithoutthe Partitioned attribute and then invoke the Storage Access API (SAA) or use the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to ensure that embedded iframes have access to the same cookies as the top level domain.Chrome 126 on Windows, MacOS, Linux

- Intent to deprecate: mutation eventsSynchronous mutation events, includingDOMSubtreeModified,DOMNodeInserted,DOMNodeRemoved,DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument,DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument, andDOMCharacterDataModified, negatively affect page performance, and also significantly increase the complexity of adding new features to the Web. These APIs were deprecated from the spec in 2011, and were replaced (in 2012) by the much better-behaved Mutation Observer API. Usage of the obsolete mutation events must be removed or migrated to Mutation Observer. Starting in Chrome 124, a temporary enterprise policy,MutationEventsEnabled, will be available to re-enable deprecated or removed mutation events.

- User link capturing on PWAsWeb links automatically direct users to installed web apps. To better align with users' expectations around installed web apps, Chrome makes it easier to move between the browser and installed web apps. When the user clicks a link that could be handled by an installed web app, Chrome adds a chip in the address bar to suggest switching over to the app. When the user clicks the chip, this either launches the app directly, or opens a grid of apps that can support that link. For some users, clicking a link always automatically opens the app.Chrome 121 on Linux, MacOS, Windows: When some users click a link, it always opens in an installed PWA, while some users see the link open in a new tab with a chip in the address bar, clicking on which will launch the app. A flag is available to control this feature:chrome://flags/#enable-user-link-capturing-pwa.Earliest in Chrome 127 on Linux, MacOS, Windows:We will launch to 100% of Stable with either a default on (always launch apps on link clicks) or a default off (always open in a tab, only launch if user clicks on chip on address bar).

- All extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3 by June 2025Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3. Chrome extensions are transitioning to a new manifest version, Manifest V3. This will bring improved privacy for your users—for example, by moving to a model where extensions modify requests declaratively, without the ability to see individual requests. This also improves extension security, as remotely hosted code will be disallowed on Manifest V3.Beginning June 2024, Chrome will gradually disable Manifest V2 extensions running in the browser. An Enterprise policy -ExtensionManifestV2Availability- is available to control whether Manifest v2 extensions are allowed. The policy can be used to test Manifest V3 in your organization ahead of the migration. Additionally, machines on which the policy is enabled will not be subject to the disabling of Manifest V2 extensions until the following year - June 2025 - at which point the policy will be removed.You can see which Manifest version is being used by all Chrome extensions running on your fleet using theApps & extensions usagepage inChrome Enterprise Core.

#### Upcoming Admin console changes

## Chrome browser updates





- Chrome Third-Party Cookie Deprecation (3PCD)Aspreviously announced, Chrome 120 started to restrict third-party cookies by default for 1% of Chrome users to facilitate testing, and subsequent releases will ramp up to 100% of users as early as Q3 2024. The ramp up to 100% of users is subject to addressing any remaining competition concerns of theUK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Browsers that are part of the 1% experiment group also see new Tracking Protection user controls. You can try out these changes in Chrome 120 or higher by enablingchrome://flags/#test-third-party-cookie-phaseout.This testing period allows sites to meaningfully preview what it's like to operate in a world without third-party cookies. Asbounce-tracking protectionsare also a part of 3PCD, the users in this group with third-party cookies blocked have bounce tracking mitigations taking effect, so that their state is cleared for sites that get classified as bounce trackers. Most enterprise users are excluded from this 1% experiment group automatically; however, we recommend that admins proactively use theBlockThirdPartyCookiesandCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicies to re-enable third-party cookies and opt out managed browsers ahead of the experiment. This gives enterprises time to make the changes required to avoid relying on this policy or on third-party cookies.We are launching theLegacy Technology Reportto help identify third-party cookies use cases. Admins can set theBlockThirdPartyCookies policyto false to re-enable third-party cookies for all sites but this will prevent users from changing the corresponding setting in Chrome. Alternatively, to prevent breakage, you can set theCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicy to allowlist your enterprise applications to continue receiving third-party cookies.For enterprise end users that are pulled into this experiment group and that are not covered by either enterprise admin policy, they can use theeye iconin the omnibox to temporarily re-enable third-party cookies for 90 days on a given site, when necessary. Seethis Help Center articlefor more details on how to toggle these settings for the desired configuration.Bounce tracking protectionsare also covered by the same policies as cookies and these protections are enforced when the bouncing site is not permitted to use 3P cookies. So setting theBlockThirdPartyCookiespolicy to false, or setting theCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicy for a site, prevents bounce tracking mitigations from deleting state for sites.Enterprise SaaS integrations used in a cross-site context for non-advertising use cases can register for thethird-party deprecation trialor thefirst-party deprecation trialfor continued access to third-party cookies for a limited period of time.Theheuristics featuregrants temporary third-party cookie access in limited scenarios based on user behavior. This mitigates site breakage caused by third-party cookie deprecation in established patterns, such as identity provider pop ups and redirects.For more details on how to prepare, provide feedback and report potential site issues, refer to our updated landing page onpreparing for the end of third-party cookies.Starting in Chrome 120 on ChromeOS, Linux, MacOS, Windows1% of global traffic has third-party cookies disabled. Enterprise users are excluded from this automatically where possible, and a policy is available to override the change.

- Private network access checks for navigation requests: warning-only modeBefore a website navigates to a destination site in a user's private network, Chrome will do the following:1. Checks whether the original navigation request has been initiated from a secure context.2. Sends a preflight request, and checks whether the destination site responds with a header that allows private network access.The above checks are made to protect the user's private network. Since this feature operates inwarning-onlymode, we do not fail the requests if any of the checks fail. Instead, a warning will be shown inDevToolsChrome console, to help developers prepare for the coming enforcement. To read about these changes, seePrivate Network Access (PNA) for Navigation Requests.

- Per-app privacy settingsChromeOS 123 makes privacy controls on Chromebooks easier to manage by consolidating app permissions and privacy controls. This gives users more transparency by showing what apps need access to privacy sensors, and how app permissions are affected by privacy control states. Now with the per-app permissions, for microphone and camera, instead of going to two separate places (privacy controls and app settings), users can directly go to privacy settings to view what apps need access to these sensors and modify app permissions.

- Enhanced Settings page experienceStarting in March 2024, all admins will use our updatedSettingspage experience–that means you’ll no longer be able to use the legacySettingspage experience. Most of you already use the updated experience. This just means that admins will no longer be able to access the legacy view, but you'll still have access to all the same functionality in the updated view.

- Inactive browser deletion in Chrome Browser Cloud ManagementThe Inactive period for browser deletion policy is now available for early access in the Admin console. For IT admins who find the 18 month default inadequate, this will allow them to explicitly set a policy value (inactivity period of time) a few weeks before the actual deletion starts.Starting in April 2024 until May 2024, theInactive period for browser deletion policywill start rolling out and automatically delete enrolled browsers in the Admin console that have been inactive for more than the inactivity period of time determined by the policy. When releasing the policy, the inactivity period of time will have a default value of 540 days. Meaning that by default, all enrolled browsers that have been inactive for more than 540 days will be deleted from your account. Administrators can change the inactive period value using this policy. The maximum value to determine the browser inactivity period will be 730 days and the minimum value is 28 days.If you lower the set policy value, it might have a global impact on any currently enrolled browsers. All impacted browsers will be considered inactive and, therefore, beirreversibly deleted. To ensure the deleted browsers re-enroll automatically next time they restart, set theDevice Token Managementpolicy value toDelete tokenbefore lowering the value of this policy. The enrollment tokens on these browsers need to still be valid at the time of the restart.

- User link capturing on PWAs - Windows, MacOS and LinuxWeb links automatically direct users to installed web apps. To better align with users' expectations around installed web apps, Chrome makes it easier to move between the browser and installed web apps. When the user clicks a link that could be handled by an installed web app, Chrome adds a chip in the address bar to suggest switching over to the app. When the user clicks the chip, this either launches the app directly, or opens a grid of apps that can support that link. For some users, clicking a link always automatically opens the app.Some issues were discovered with the current implementation, so we will not launch this feature in Chrome 123 as initially announced. We definitely plan to launch link capturing this year (bug).Chrome 121 on Linux, MacOS, Windows: When some users click a link, it always opens in an installed PWA, while some users see the link open in a new tab with a chip in the address bar, clicking on which will launch the app. A flag is available to control this feature: chrome://flags/#enable-user-link-capturing-pwa.Future milestone in 2024 on Linux, MacOS, Windows:We will launch to 100% of Stable with either a default on (always launch apps on link clicks) or a default off (always open in a tab, only launch if user clicks on chip on address bar).

- Permissions prompt for Web MIDI APIThe Web MIDI API connects to and interacts with Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) Devices. There have beenseveral reported problemsaround Web MIDI API's drive-by access to client MIDI devices (see relatedChromium bug). To address this problem, the W3CAudio Working Groupdecided to place an explicit permission on generalWeb MIDI API access. Originally, the explicit permission was only required for advanced Web MIDI usage in Chrome, including the ability to send and receive system exclusive (SysEx) messages, with gated access behind a permissions prompt. We now intend to expand the scope of the permission to regular Web MIDI API usage.In Chrome 124, all access to the Web MIDI API will require a user permission. No policies will be available to control these changes. If you encounter any issues, file a bughere.Chrome 124 on Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android

- Intent to deprecate: mutation eventsSynchronous mutation events, includingDOMSubtreeModified, DOMNodeInserted, DOMNodeRemoved, DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument, DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument, andDOMCharacterDataModified, negatively affect page performance, and also significantly increase the complexity of adding new features to the Web. These APIs were deprecated from the spec in 2011, and were replaced (in 2012) by the much better-behaved Mutation Observer API. Usage of the obsolete mutation events must be removed or migrated to Mutation Observer. Starting in Chrome 124, a temporary enterprise policy,MutationEventsEnabled, will be available to re-enable deprecated or removed mutation events. If you encounter any issues, file a bughere.Chrome 127 on Android, ChromeOS, Linux, MacOS, Windows:Mutation events will stop functioning in Chrome 127, around July 30, 2024.

- All extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3 by June 2025Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3. Chrome extensions are transitioning to a new manifest version, Manifest V3. This will bring improved privacy for your users—for example, by moving to a model where extensions modify requests declaratively, without the ability to see individual requests. This also improves extension security, as remotely hosted code will be disallowed on Manifest V3.Beginning June 2024, Chrome will gradually disable Manifest V2 extensions running in the browser. An Enterprise policy -ExtensionManifestV2Availability- is available to control whether Manifest v2 extensions are allowed. The policy can be used to test Manifest V3 in your organization ahead of the migration. Additionally, machines on which the policy is enabled will not be subject to the disabling of Manifest V2 extensions until the following year - June 2025 - at which point the policy will be removed.You can see which Manifest version is being used by all Chrome extensions running on your fleet using theApps & extensions usagepage in Chrome Browser Cloud Management.

#### Upcoming Admin console changes

## Chrome browser updates





- Chrome Third-Party Cookie Deprecation (3PCD)Aspreviously announced, Chrome 120 started to restrict third-party cookies by default for 1% of Chrome users to facilitate testing, and subsequent releases will ramp up to 100% of users as early as Q3 2024. The ramp up to 100% of users is subject to addressing any remaining competition concerns of theUK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Browsers that are part of the 1% experiment group also see new Tracking Protection user controls. You can try out these changes in Chrome 120 or higher by enablingchrome://flags/#test-third-party-cookie-phaseout.This testing period allows sites to meaningfully preview what it's like to operate in a world without third-party cookies. Asbounce-tracking protectionsare also a part of 3PCD, the users in this group with third-party cookies blocked have bounce tracking mitigations taking effect, so that their state is cleared for sites that get classified as bounce trackers. Most enterprise users are excluded from this 1% experiment group automatically; however, we recommend that admins proactively use theBlockThirdPartyCookiesandCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicies to re-enable third-party cookies and opt out managed browsers ahead of the experiment. This gives enterprises time to make the changes required to avoid relying on this policy or on third-party cookies.We are launching theLegacy Technology Reportto help identify third-party cookies use cases. Admins can set theBlockThirdPartyCookies policyto false to re-enable third-party cookies for all sites but this will prevent users from changing the corresponding setting in Chrome. Alternatively, to prevent breakage, you can set theCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicy to allowlist your enterprise applications to continue receiving third-party cookies.For enterprise end users that are pulled into this experiment group and that are not covered by either enterprise admin policy, they can use theeye iconin the omnibox to temporarily re-enable third-party cookies for 90 days on a given site, when necessary. Seethis help articlefor more details on how to toggle these settings for the desired configuration.Bounce tracking protectionsare also covered by the same policies as cookies and these protections are enforced when the bouncing site is not permitted to use 3P cookies. So setting theBlockThirdPartyCookiespolicy to false, or setting theCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicy for a site, prevents bounce tracking mitigations from deleting state for sites.Enterprise SaaS integrations used in a cross-site context for non-advertising use cases can register for thethird-party deprecation trialor thefirst-party deprecation trialfor continued access to third-party cookies for a limited period of time.Theheuristics featuregrants temporary third-party cookie access in limited scenarios based on user behavior. This mitigates site breakage caused by third-party cookie deprecation in established patterns, such as identity provider pop ups and redirects.For more details on how to prepare, provide feedback and report potential site issues, refer to our updated landing page onpreparing for the end of third-party cookies.Starting in Chrome 120 on ChromeOS, Linux, MacOS, Windows1% of global traffic has third-party cookies disabled. Enterprise users are excluded from this automatically where possible, and a policy is available to override the change.

- Simplified sign-in and sync experience on iOSStarting in Chrome 122, existing users on iOS with Chrome sync turned on now experience a simplified and consolidated version of sign-in and sync in Chrome. Chrome sync no longer appears as a separate feature in settings or elsewhere. Instead, users can sign in to Chrome to use and save information like passwords, bookmarks and more in their Google Account, subject to the relevant enterprise policies.As before, the functionality that saves and accesses Chrome data in the Google Account can be turned off fully (viaSyncDisabled) or partially (viaSyncTypesListDisabled). Sign-in to Chrome can be required or disabled viaBrowserSigninas before.Note that the changes do not affect users’ ability to sign in to Google services on the web (like Gmail) without signing in to Chrome, their ability to stay signed out of Chrome, or their ability to control what information is synced with their Google Account.Chrome 117: no longer shows Chrome sync as a separate feature for users who didn't have Chrome sync enabled at the time.Chrome122: no longer shows Chrome sync as a separate feature for users who had Chrome sync enabled by migrating them to an equivalent state.

To improve Chrome's loading speed, checks with the server-side Safe Browsing list no longer block page loads in Chrome 122.We have evaluated the risk and put mitigations in place:1) To protect against direct exploits against the browser, local list checks are still conducted in a synchronous manner so that malicious payloads cannot run until the local list check is complete.2) To protect against phishing attacks, we've looked at data and concluded that it is unlikely the user would have significantly interacted with the page (for example, typed a password) by the time we show a warning.Chrome 122 on Android, ChromeOS, LaCrOS, Linux, MacOS, Windows:Feature launches

- Inactive browser deletion in Chrome Browser Cloud ManagementAs early as March 2024, theInactive period for browser deletion policywill automatically delete browser data in the Admin console for managed browsers that have not contacted the server for more than the inactivity period of time determined by the policy. When releasing the policy, the inactivity period of time will have a default value of 540 days. All enrolled browsers that have been inactive for more than 540 days will be deleted from your account shortly after the release of this policy. Administrators can change the inactive period value using this policy. The maximum value to determine the browser inactivity period will be 730 days and the minimum value is 28 days.If you lower the set policy value, it might have a global impact on any currently enrolled browsers. All impacted browsers will be considered inactive and, therefore, beirreversibly deleted. To ensure the deleted browsers re-enroll automatically next time they restart, set theDevice Token Managementpolicy value toDelete tokenbefore lowering the value of this policy. The enrollment tokens on these browsers need to still be valid at the time of the restart.As early as Chrome 122:The Inactive period for browser deletion policy UI will be available for early access in the Admin console.

- User link capturing on PWAs - Windows, MacOS and LinuxWeb links automatically direct users to installed web apps. To better align with users' expectations around installed web apps, Chrome makes it more seamless to move between the browser and installed web apps. When the user clicks on a link that could be handled by an installed web app, Chrome adds a chip in the address bar to suggest switching over to the app. Clicking on the chip either launches the app directly, or opens a grid of apps that can support that link. For some users, clicking on a link always automatically opens the app.Chrome 121 on Linux, MacOS, Windows: When some users click on a link, it always opens in an installed PWA, while some users see the link open in a new tab with a chip in the address bar, clicking on which will launch the app. A flag is available to control this feature: chrome://flags/#enable-user-link-capturing-pwa.Chrome 123 on Linux, MacOS, Windows:Based on the outcome of the experiment in Chrome 121, we will launch to 100% of Stable with either a default on (always launch apps on link clicks) or a default off (always open in a tab, only launch if user clicks on chip on address bar).

- Permissions prompt for Web MIDI APIThe Web MIDI API connects to and interacts with Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) Devices. There have beenseveral reported problemsaround Web MIDI API's drive-by access to client MIDI devices (see relatedChromium bug). To address this problem, the W3CAudio Working Groupdecided to place an explicit permission on generalWeb MIDI API access. Originally, the explicit permission was only required for advanced Web MIDI usage in Chrome, including the ability to send and receive system exclusive (SysEx) messages, with gated access behind a permissions prompt. We now intend to expand the scope of the permission to regular Web MIDI API usage.In Chrome 123, all access to the Web MIDI API will require a user permission.

- Private network access checks for navigation requests: warning-only modeBefore a website navigates to a destination site in a user's private network, Chrome will do the following:1. Checks whether the original navigation request has been initiated from a secure context.2. Sends a preflight request, and checks whether the destination site responds with a header that allows private network access.The above checks are made to protect the user's private network. Since this feature operates inwarning-onlymode, we do not fail the requests if any of the checks fail. Instead, a warning will be shown inDevToolsChrome console, to help developers prepare for the coming enforcement. To read about these changes, seePrivate Network Access (PNA) for Navigation Requests.

- Intent to deprecate: Mutation EventsSynchronous Mutation Events, includingDOMSubtreeModified,DOMNodeInserted,DOMNodeRemoved,DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument,DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument, andDOMCharacterDataModified, negatively affect page performance, and also significantly increase the complexity of adding new features to the Web. These APIs were deprecated from the spec in 2011, and were replaced (in 2012) by the much better-behaved Mutation Observer API. Usage of the obsolete Mutation Events must be removed or migrated to Mutation Observer.Chrome 127 on Android, ChromeOS, Linux, MacOS, Windows:Mutation Events will stop functioning in Chrome 127, around July 30, 2024.

- Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3 by June 2025Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3. Chrome extensions are transitioning to a new manifest version, Manifest V3. This will bring improved privacy for your users—for example, by moving to a model where extensions modify requests declaratively, without the ability to see individual requests. This also improves extension security, as remotely hosted code will be disallowed on Manifest V3.Beginning June 2024, Chrome will gradually disable Manifest V2 extensions running in the browser. An Enterprise policy -ExtensionManifestV2Availability- is available to control whether Manifest v2 extensions are allowed. The policy can be used to test Manifest V3 in your organization ahead of the migration. Additionally, machines on which the policy is enabled will not be subject to the disabling of Manifest V2 extensions until the following year - June 2025 - at which point the policy will be removed.You can see which Manifest version is being used by all Chrome extensions running on your fleet using the Apps & extensions usage page in Chrome Browser Cloud Management.

- Customizing keyboard shortcutsUsing shortcuts boosts productivity, and we all have our favorites. As early as ChromeOS 123, with shortcut customization, you will be able to assign your preferred key combination to personalize your shortcuts. Whether you want them to be easier to do with one hand, simpler to remember, or identical to the ones you're familiar with, this feature will simplify your day-to-day workflows.





- Record GIFs with Screen captureAs early as ChromeOS 124,Screen capturewill let you record your screen in .GIF format to easily capture, share, and play the recording inline in chat, slides, docs, and more.





- Faster Split Screen setupChromebooks provide a variety of ways to arrange the windows on your screen to help make you more productive — one of which is Split Screen. Just as it sounds, Faster Split Screen Setup will offer a quicker way to set up your window layout by showing an overview of your open windows on the other side of the screen. With Faster Split Screen, once you "snap" (or lock) a window in place on one side, you can choose an already-open window from Overview to snap into the other side, or select something from the shelf (the row of apps located at the bottom or side of your screen).

## Chrome browser updates





- Chrome Third-Party Cookie Deprecation (3PCD)Aspreviously announced, Chrome 121 restricts third-party cookies by default for 1% of Chrome users to facilitate testing, and plans to ramp up to 100% of users from Q3 2024. The ramp up to 100% of users is subject to addressing any remaining competition concerns of theUK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Browsers that are part of the 1% experiment group will also see new Tracking Protection user controls. You can try out these changes in Chrome 121 or higher by enablingchrome://flags/#test-third-party-cookie-phaseout.This testing period allows sites to meaningfully preview what it's like to operate in a world without third-party cookies. Asbounce-tracking protectionsare also a part of 3PCD, the users in this group with third-party cookies blocked have bounce tracking mitigations taking effect, so that their state is cleared for sites that get classified as bounce trackers. Most enterprise users should be excluded from this 1% experiment group automatically; however, we recommend that admins proactively use theBlockThirdPartyCookiesandCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicies to re-enable third-party cookies and opt out their managed browsers ahead of the experiment. This gives enterprises time to make the changes required to not rely on this policy or third-party cookies.We are launching theLegacy Technology Reportto help identify third-party cookies use cases. Admins can set theBlockThirdPartyCookies policyto false to re-enable third-party cookies for all sites but this will prevent users from changing the corresponding setting in Chrome. Alternatively, to prevent breakage, you can set theCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicy to allowlist your enterprise applications to continue receiving third-party cookies.For enterprise end users that are pulled into this experiment group and that are not covered by either enterprise admin policy, they can use theeye iconin the omnibox to temporarily re-enable third-party cookies for 90 days on a given site, when necessary. Seethis help articlefor more details on how to toggle these settings for the desired configuration.Bounce tracking protectionsare also covered by the same policies as cookies and these protections are enforced when the bouncing site is not permitted to use 3P cookies. So setting theBlockThirdPartyCookiespolicy to false, or setting theCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicy for a site, prevents bounce tracking mitigations from deleting state for sites.Enterprise SaaS integrations used in a cross-site context for non-advertising use cases can register for thethird-party deprecation trialfor continued access to third-party cookies for a limited period of time.Theheuristics featuregrants temporary third-party cookie access in limited scenarios based on user behavior. This mitigates site breakage caused by third-party cookie deprecation in established patterns, such as identity provider pop ups and redirects.For more details on how to prepare, provide feedback and report potential site issues, refer to our updated landing page onpreparing for the end of third-party cookies.Starting in Chrome 120 on ChromeOS, Linux, MacOS, Windows1% of global traffic has third-party cookies disabled.

- User Link Capturing on PWAs - Windows, MacOS and LinuxWeb links automatically direct users to installed web apps. To better align with users' expectations around installed web apps, Chrome makes it more seamless to move between the browser and installed web apps. When the user clicks on a link that could be handled by an installed web app, Chrome adds a chip in the address bar to suggest switching over to the app. Clicking on the chip either launches the app directly, or opens a grid of apps that can support that link. For some users, clicking on a link always automatically opens the app.Chrome 121 on Linux, MacOS, Windows:When some users click on a link, it always opens in an installed PWA, while some users see the link open in a new tab with a chip in the address bar; clicking on the chip launches the app. A flag is available to control this feature:chrome://flags/#enable-user-link-capturing-pwa.Chrome 123 on Linux, MacOS, Windows: Based on the outcome of the experiment in Chrome 121, we will launch to 100% of Stable with either a default on (always launch apps on link clicks) or a default off (always open in a tab, only launch if user clicks on chip on address bar).

- Autofill: display in server cards and local cardsAutofill helps users seamlessly fill out their card information into payment forms. Credit or debit cards, which can be autofilled, are stored on the Chrome client. There are 2 types: Server cards and Local cards. A server card only has the last 4 digits and the expiry date of the card whereas a local card has all the digits of a card along with the expiry date.There are instances when a local and server card of the same card exist on the same client. When that happens, Chrome typically dedupes the server card and only offers the local card for autofilling. With this change, the opposite is true, and server card usage is now offered to users instead. This brings the security and usability benefits of GPay server cards to users with duplicate cards, as well as makes the experience more consistent across devices.Chrome 121 on Chrome OS, LaCrOS, Linux, MacOS, Windows, Fuchsia

- CSS Highlight InheritanceWith CSS Highlight Inheritance, the CSS Highlight pseudo classes, such as ::selectionand::highlight, inherit their properties through the pseudo highlight chain, rather than the element chain. The result is a more intuitive model for inheritance of properties in highlights. Specifically, when any supported property is not given a value by the cascade, its specified value is determined by inheritance from the corresponding highlight pseudo-element of its originating element’s parent element. For more details, see theHighlight Pseudo-elementsspecification.Chrome 121 on Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android

- Simplified sign-in and sync experienceStarting in Chrome 122, existing users with Chrome sync turned on will experience a simplified and consolidated version of sign-in and sync in Chrome. Chrome sync will no longer be shown as a separate feature in settings or elsewhere. Instead, users can sign in to Chrome to use and save information like passwords, bookmarks and more in their Google Account, subject to the relevant enterprise policies.As before, the functionality previously part of Chrome sync that saves and accesses Chrome data in the Google Account can be turned off fully (viaSyncDisabled) or partially (viaSyncTypesListDisabled). Sign-in to Chrome can be required or disabled viaBrowserSigninas before.Note that the changes do not affect users’ ability to sign in to Google services on the web (like Gmail) without signing in to Chrome, their ability to stay signed out of Chrome, or their ability to control what information is synced with their Google Account.Chrome 117: sunset Chrome sync for users who didn't have Chrome sync enabled at the time.Chrome122: sunset Chrome sync for users with Chrome sync enabled by migrating them to an equivalent state.

- Permissions prompt for Web MIDI APIThere have beenseveral reported problemsaround Web MIDI API's drive-by access to client MIDI devices (bugs). To address this problem, the Audio WG decided to place an explicit permission on the generalMIDI API access. Originally, the explicit permission was only required for advanced MIDI usage (System Exclusive (SysEx) messages) in Chrome, with gated access behind a permissions prompt. We plan to  expand the scope of the permission to regular MIDI API usage.Today the use of SysEx messages with the Web MIDI API requires an explicit user permission. With this implementation, even access to the Web MIDI API without SysEx support will require a user permission. Three new policies—DefaultMidiSetting, MidiAllowedForUrls and MidiBlockedForUrls—will be available to allow administrators to pre-configure user access to the API.Chrome 122 on Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android

- Deprecate and remove WebSQLWith SQLite over WASM as its official replacement, we plan to remove WebSQL entirely. This will help keep our users secure.The Web SQL Database standard was first proposed in April 2009 and abandoned in November 2010. Gecko never implemented this feature and WebKit deprecated this feature in 2019. The W3C encouraged those needing web databases to adopt Web Storage or Indexed Database.Ever since its release, it has made it incredibly difficult to keep our users secure. SQLite was not initially designed to run malicious SQL statements, and yet with WebSQL we have to do exactly this.

- Intent to deprecate: Mutation EventsSynchronous Mutation Events, includingDOMSubtreeModified,DOMNodeInserted,DOMNodeRemoved,DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument,DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument, andDOMCharacterDataModified, negatively affect page performance, and also significantly increase the complexity of adding new features to the Web. These APIs were deprecated from the spec in 2011, and were replaced (in 2012) by the much better-behaved Mutation Observer API. Usage of the obsolete Mutation Events must be removed or migrated to Mutation Observer.Chrome 127 on Android, ChromeOS, Linux, MacOS, Windows:Mutation Events will stop functioning in Chrome 127, around July 30, 2024.

- Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3 by June 2025Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3. Chrome extensions are transitioning to a new manifest version, Manifest V3. This will bring improved privacy for your users—for example, by moving to a model where extensions modify requests declaratively, without the ability to see individual requests. This also improves extension security, as remotely hosted code will be disallowed on Manifest V3.Beginning June 2024, Chrome will gradually disable Manifest V2 extensions running in the browser. An Enterprise policy -ExtensionManifestV2Availability- is available to control whether Manifest v2 extensions are allowed. The policy can be used to test Manifest V3 in your organization ahead of the migration. Additionally, machines on which the policy is enabled will not be subject to the disabling of Manifest V2 extensions until the following year - June 2025 - at which point the policy will be removed.You can see which Manifest version is being used by all Chrome extensions running on your fleet using the Apps & extensions usage page in Chrome Browser Cloud Management.

- Inactive browser deletion in Chrome Browser Cloud ManagementAs early as Chrome 124, theInactive period for browser deletion policywill automatically delete browser data in the Admin console for managed browsers that have not contacted the server for more than the inactivity period of time determined by the policy. When releasing the policy, the inactivity period of time will have a default value of 540 days. All enrolled browsers that have been inactive for more than 540 days will be deleted from your account shortly after the release of this policy. Administrators can change the inactive period value using this policy. The maximum value to determine the browser inactivity period will be 730 days and the minimum value is 28 days.If you lower the set policy value, it might have a global impact on any currently enrolled browsers. All impacted browsers will be considered inactive and, therefore, beirreversibly deleted. To ensure the deleted browsers re-enroll automatically next time they restart, set theDevice Token Managementpolicy value toDelete tokenbefore lowering the value of this policy. The enrollment tokens on these browsers need to still be valid at the time of the restart.As early as Chrome 122:The Inactive period for browser deletion policy UI will be available for early access in the Admin console.

#### Upcoming Admin console changes

## Chrome browser updates





- Default Search Engine choice screenStarting Chrome 120, enterprise end-users might be prompted to choose their default search engine within Chrome.As part of our building forDMA compliance, some users will be prompted to choose their default search engine for Chrome. This prompt controls the default search engine setting, currently available atchrome://settings/search. The enterprise policies,DefaultSearchProviderEnabledandDefaultSearchProviderSearchUrl, will continue to control this setting as it does today, if it is set by the IT admin. Read more onthis policy and the related atomic group.Chrome 120 on iOS, Chrome OS, LaCrOS, Linux, Mac, Windows:1% users might start getting the choice screen with Chrome 120. 100% by Chrome 122 for applicable users.

- Chrome Third-Party Cookie Deprecation (3PCD)In Chrome 120 and beyond (Jan 2024), Chrome will globally disable third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome traffic as part of ourChrome-facilitated testingin collaboration with theCMA. The facilitated testing period allows sites to meaningfully preview what it's like to operate in a world without third-party cookies. Asbounce-tracking protectionsare also a part of 3PCD, the users in this group with third-party cookies blocked will have bounce tracking mitigations take effect, so that their state is cleared for sites that get classified as a bounce tracker. Most enterprise users should be excluded from this experiment group automatically; however, we recommend that admins proactively use theBlockThirdPartyCookiesandCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicies to re-enable third-party cookies and opt out their managed browsers ahead of the experiment. This will give enterprises time to make the changes required to not rely on this policy or third-party cookies.We plan to provide more tooling (such as theLegacy Tech Report)  to help identify third-party cookies use cases. Admins can set theBlockThirdPartyCookies policyto false to re-enable third-party cookies for all sites but this will prevent users from changing the corresponding setting in Chrome. Alternatively, to prevent breakage, you can set theCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicy to allowlist your enterprise applications to continue receiving third-party cookies.For enterprise end users that are pulled into this experiment group and that are not covered by either enterprise admin policy, they can use the User Bypass control (the “eye icon” in the omnibox)  to temporarily re-enable third-party cookies for 90 days on a given site when necessary. Enterprise admin policies override User Bypass controls, for example, settingBlockThirdPartyCookies policyto true will disable third-party cookies for all sites and prevent users from using this User Bypass control.Bounce tracking protectionsare also covered by the same policies as cookies and enforced when the bouncing site is not permitted to have/receive 3P cookies. Thus, setting theBlockThirdPartyCookiespolicy to false, or setting theCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicy for a site, will prevent bounce tracking mitigations from deleting state for sites.Enterprise SaaS integrations used in a cross-site context for non-advertising use cases will be able to register for thethird-party cookie deprecation trialfor continued access to third-party cookies for a limited period of time.Theheuristics featurewill grant temporary third-party cookie access in limited scenarios based on user behavior. This mitigates site breakage caused by third-party cookie deprecation in established patterns such as identity provider pop ups and redirects.For more details on how to prepare, provide feedback and report potential site issues, refer to theMode B: 1% third-party cookie deprecationblog sectionand thePreparing for the end of third-party cookiesblog.Chrome 120 on ChromeOS, Linux, Mac, Windows1% of global traffic has third-party cookies disabled.

- Chrome Web Store: UX improvementsThe Chrome team is unveiling a redesigned Chrome Web Store that simplifies the process of finding and managing extensions. Alongside a refreshing, modern interface, the store introduces new extension categories, includingAI-powered extensionsandEditors' spotlight. These enhancements will be gradually rolled out over the coming months.Users can temporarily switch back to the original store layout by clicking the three dots next to their profile avatar and selecting Revert to original store. This temporary option will be disabled in January 2024 and cannot be centrally controlled by administrators.Enterprises will continue to have access to their enterprise policies within the new Chrome Store UX.The revamped Chrome Web Store will also feature a dedicated section for extensions specific to your domain. For more details on publishing private extensions, seeEnterprise Publishing Options.Note that there is a known issue withExtensionSettings, where theblocked_install_messagedoes not appear correctly in the redesigned Chrome Store UX that we are working on fixing.

- Deprecate and remove Theora supportChrome 120 deprecates and removes support for theTheoravideo codec in Chrome desktop, due to emerging security risks. Theora's low (and now often incorrect) usage no longer justifies support for most users.Oggcontainers will remain supported. Our plan is to begin escalating experiments turning down Theora support in Chrome 120. If users encounter problems playing specific videos, they can reactivate support viachrome://flags/#theora-video-codecif needed until Chrome 123.

- Printing interactions moved to a service processIn Chrome 120, some users have the printing interactions with the operating system performed in a separate service process. Moving these interactions out of the browser process improves browser stability. It also improves the responsiveness of thePrint Previewuser interface.

- URL-Based Permission Suggestions ServiceChrome is upgrading its Permission Suggestions Service. Earlier the requests to Chrome servers for permission suggestion service didn't contain URLs. Now Chrome will add URL based signals to the suggestion service. Earlier admins could disable sending requests to Chrome by setting theSafeBrowsingProtectionLevelpolicy to 1, 0 or unset. After this update theSafeBrowsingProtectionLevelpolicy will no longer enable/disable the Permission Suggestion Service.The Permission Suggestions Service is now gated behind the existing URL-keyed anonymized data collection policy:UrlKeyedAnonymizedDataCollectionEnabled.Chrome 120 on ChromeOS, Linux, Mac, Windows:1% stable experiment

#### Upcoming browser changes





- Generative AI featuresIn Chrome 115, Google introduced its first Generative AI (GenAI) integration in the Search Side Panel. As early as Chrome 121, additional GenAI features will be rolled out to Chrome. You’ll be able to opt in through a newchrome://settingspage. Enterprise policies will be available at roll-out to control these features. More details will be shared in upcoming milestones.(Earliest) Chrome 121 on ChromeOS, Linux, Mac, Windows

- Safer encrypted archives for Standard Safe Browsing usersStandard Safe Browsing users will be prompted for a password to some encrypted archive downloads. This will be used to collect more metadata about the download (such as contained file hashes and executable signatures), which will be sent to Google for better quality verdicts. The password will remain local. You can control this feature with theSafeBrowsingDeepScanningEnabledpolicy.Chrome 121 on Linux, Mac, Windows

- Permissions prompt for Web MIDI APIThere have beenseveral reported problemsaround Web MIDI API's drive-by access to client MIDI devices (bugs). To address this problem, the Audio WG decided to place an explicit permission on the generalMIDI API access. Originally, the explicit permission was only required for advanced MIDI usage (System Exclusive (SysEx) messages) in Chrome, with gated access behind a permissions prompt. We plan to  expand the scope of the permission to regular MIDI API usage.Today the use of SysEx messages with the Web MIDI API requires an explicit user permission. With this implementation, even access to the Web MIDI API without SysEx support will require a user permission. Three new policies—DefaultMidiSetting, MidiAllowedForUrls and MidiBlockedForUrls—will be available to allow administrators to pre-configure user access to the API.Chrome 121 on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android

- Network Service on Windows will be sandboxedTo improve security and reliability, the network service, already running in its own process, will be sandboxed on Windows. As part of this, third-party code that is currently able to tamper with the network service may be prevented from doing so. This might cause interoperability issues with software that injects code into Chrome's process space, such as Data Loss Prevention software. TheNetworkServiceSandboxEnabledpolicy allows you to disable the sandbox if incompatibilities are discovered. You can test the sandbox in your environment usingtheseinstructions andreportany issues you encounter.Chrome 121 on Windows:Network Service sandboxed on Windows

- User Link Capturing on PWAs - Windows, Mac and LinuxWeb links automatically direct users to installed web apps. To better align with users' expectations around installed web apps, Chrome will make it more seamless to move between the browser and installed web apps. When the user clicks on a link that could be handled by an installed web app, Chrome will add a chip in the address bar to suggest switching over to the app. Clicking on the chip would either launch the app directly, or open a grid of apps that can support that link. For some users, clicking on a link will always automatically open the app.Chrome 121 on Linux, Mac, Windows:When some users click on a link, it will always open in an installed PWA, while some users will see the link open in a new tab with a chip in the address bar clicking on which will launch the app. This is an experiment to determine if users prefer having links launched by default. The experiment will run on Canary/Dev/Beta and 1% of Stable.Chrome 123 on Linux, Mac, Windows: Based on the outcome of the experiment in Chrome 121, we will launch to 100% of Stable with either a default on (always launch apps on link clicks) or a default off (always open in a tab, only launch if user clicks on chip on address bar).

- Skip unload eventsThe presence of unload event listeners is a primary blocker forback/forward cacheon Chromium based browsers and for Firefox on desktop platforms. On the other hand, for mobile platforms, almost all browsers prioritize thebfcacheby not firing unload events in most cases. To improve the situation, we’ve been working with lots of partners and successfully reduced the use of unload event listeners over the last few years. To further accelerate this migration, weproposeto have Chrome for desktop gradually skip unload events.In case you need more time tomigrate away from unload events, we’ll offer temporary opt-outs in the form of a Permissions-Policy API and an enterprise policyForcePermissionPolicyUnloadDefaultEnabled, which will allow you to selectively keep the behavior unchanged.Chrome 117 on Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, Windows: Dev TrialChrome 119 on Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, Windows: IntroducesForcePermissionPolicyUnloadDefaultEnabledpolicyChrome 121 -131 on Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, Windows:Deprecation trial(general rollout of deprecation will be limited scope until deprecation trial is ready)

- Deprecate and remove WebSQLWith SQLite over WASM as its official replacement, we plan to remove WebSQL entirely. This will help keep our users secure.The Web SQL Database standard was first proposed in April 2009 and abandoned in November 2010. Gecko never implemented this feature and WebKit deprecated this feature in 2019. The W3C encouraged those needing web databases to adopt Web Storage or Indexed Database.Ever since its release, it has made it incredibly difficult to keep our users secure. SQLite was not initially designed to run malicious SQL statements, and yet with WebSQL we have to do exactly this. Having to react to a flow of stability and security issues is an unpredictable cost to the storage team.Chrome 115: Deprecation message added to console.Chrome 117: In Chrome 117 the WebSQL Deprecation Trial starts. The trial ends in Chrome 123. During the trial period, a policy,WebSQLAccess, is needed for the feature to be available.Chrome 119: Starting Chrome 119, WebSQL is no longer available.

- Intent to deprecate: Mutation EventsSynchronous Mutation Events, includingDOMSubtreeModified,DOMNodeInserted,DOMNodeRemoved,DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument,DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument, andDOMCharacterDataModified, negatively affect page performance, and also significantly increase the complexity of adding new features to the Web. These APIs were deprecated from the spec in 2011, and were replaced (in 2012) by the much better-behaved Mutation Observer API. Usage of the obsolete Mutation Events must be removed or migrated to Mutation Observer.Chrome 127 on Android, ChromeOS, Linux, Mac, Windows:Mutation Events will stop functioning in Chrome 127, around July 30, 2024.

- Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3 by June 2025Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3. Chrome extensions are transitioning to a new manifest version, Manifest V3. This will bring improved privacy for your users—for example, by moving to a model where extensions modify requests declaratively, without the ability to see individual requests. This also improves extension security, as remotely hosted code will be disallowed on Manifest V3.Beginning June 2024, Chrome will gradually disable Manifest V2 extensions running in the browser. An Enterprise policy -ExtensionManifestV2Availability- is available to control whether Manifest v2 extensions are allowed. The policy can be used to test Manifest V3 in your organization ahead of the migration. Additionally, machines on which the policy is enabled will not be subject to the disabling of Manifest V2 extensions until the following year - June 2025 - at which point the policy will be removed.You can see which Manifest version is being used by all Chrome extensions running on your fleet using the Apps & extensions usage page in Chrome Browser Cloud Management.

Users can now choose how long their screensaver runs while their device is charging (not on battery). You can control this using a new enterprise policy. The default setting is Forever, and can be reduced using drop-down options.





- New look for ChromeOS media playerAs early as ChromeOS 121, the media player will have bigger buttons and colors to match your wallpaper. The media player will appear when you are playing any video or audio (like Spotify or YouTube) in Quick Settings. You will be able to click the pin icon to move the media player to the shelf. In addition to controlling media that is being cast, you will be able to start casting web media to any speakers or screens on your local network.





- Integrate the DLP events rule Id and name into the security investigation toolChromeOS Data Control events, for Data Loss Prevention (DLP), will have additional fields to enrich admin insights in the security investigation tool.





- ChromeOSData Controls file restrictionsIn ChromeOS 121, ChromeOS Data Controls, for DLP,will enable IT and Security teams to protect important business and customer data. It will be available for events like copy and paste, screen capture, screen sharing, and printing. IT administrators will be able to create an information protection strategy with rules based on the data source, destination and user.We will have new functionality to control what users can do with files on ChromeOS devices through source and destination based rules.





- Enhanced notifications for pinned appsAs early as ChromeOS 121, you will be able to visually separate pinned notifications from other notifications. We will change the visual specs, buttons, and notification text to fit within fixed size bubbles. This significantly differentiates the visual look of pinned notifications from typical notifications to reflect their significant difference in purpose (notifying the user of an ongoing process rather than an instantaneous event).





- New ChromeOS sync optionsChromeOS will soon deliver an updated device setup experience that lets users customize sync settings for apps, settings, wi-fi networks, and wallpaper.





- App disablement by Admin in MGSUp until now, Managed Guest Sessions (MGS) include a set of applications (Explore, Gallery, and Terminal apps) that are available to the user. With theSystemFeaturesDisableListpolicy, Admins will soon be able to disable these apps, blocking and hiding them from users across your enterprise.

- Inactive browser deletion in Chrome Browser Cloud ManagementAs early as Chrome 123, theInactive period for browser data deletion policywill be added to the Admin Console and it will automatically delete browsers that have not contacted the server for more than the inactivity period of time determined by the policy. When releasing the policy, the inactivity period of time will have a default value of 18 months. All enrolled browsers that have been inactive for more than 18 months will be deleted from your account shortly after the release of this policy. The maximum value to determine the browser inactivity period will be 730 days and the minimum value is 28 days.Note.Shortening the period significantly will cause more enrolled browsers to be considered inactive and deleted, and should be done with caution. To mitigate this, you can set theDevice Token Managementpolicy value to “Delete token” ahead of time, which allows deleted browsers to automatically re-enroll in Chrome Browser Cloud Management the next time the browser restarts (if the enrollment token is still valid). You can find theDevice Token Management policy here.As early as Chrome 121:The Inactive period for browser data deletion policy UI will be available for early access in the Admin console. For IT admins who find the 18 month default inadequate, this will allow them to explicitly set a policy value (inactivity period of time) a few weeks before the actual deletion starts.
- As early as Chrome 121:The Inactive period for browser data deletion policy UI will be available for early access in the Admin console.

## Chrome browser updates





- Chrome release schedule changesChrome 119 and all subsequent releases will be moved forward by one week. For example, Chrome 119 has its early stable release on October 25 instead of Nov 1. Beta releases will also be moved forward by one week starting in Chrome 119.For more details, see theChrome Release Schedule.Chrome 119 on Android, iOS, ChromeOS, Linux, Mac, Windows

- Deprecate and remove WebSQLWith SQLite over WASM as its official replacement, we plan to remove WebSQL entirely. This will help keep our users secure.The Web SQL Database standard was first proposed in April 2009 and abandoned in November 2010. Gecko never implemented this feature and WebKit deprecated this feature in 2019. The W3C encouraged those needing web databases to adopt Web Storage or Indexed Database.Ever since its release, it has made it incredibly difficult to keep our users secure. SQLite was not initially designed to run malicious SQL statements, and yet with WebSQL we have to do exactly this. Having to react to a flow of stability and security issues is an unpredictable cost to the storage team.Chrome 115: Deprecation message added to console.Chrome 117: In Chrome 117 the WebSQL Deprecation Trial starts. The trial ends in Chrome 123. During the trial period, a policy,WebSQLAccess, is needed for the feature to be available.Chrome 119:Starting Chrome 119, WebSQL is no longer available. Access to the feature is available until Chrome 123 using theWebSQLAccesspolicy.Chrome 123: on Chrome OS, LaCrOS, Linux, Mac, Windows: Starting in Chrome 123, the policy WebSQLAccess, which allows for WebSQL to be available will no longer be available.

- Remove Sanitizer APITo prevent the currentSanitizer APIfrom becoming entrenched, we plan to remove the current implementation. We expect to re-implement the Sanitizer API when the proposed specification stabilizes again.The Sanitizer API aims to build an easy-to-use, always secure, browser-maintained HTML sanitizer into the platform. We shipped an initial version of the Sanitizer API in Chrome 105, based on the then-current specification draft. However, the standards discussion has meanwhile moved on and the proposed API shape has changed substantially.Chrome 119 on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android

- Tab Groups can be saved, recalled, and syncedUsers can now save tab groups, which allows them to close and re-open the tabs in the group, as well as sync them across devices. You can disable syncing Tab Groups using theSyncTypesListDisabledpolicy.Chrome 119 on ChromeOS, Linux, Mac, Windows

- Deprecate non-standardshadowrootattribute for declarative Shadow DOMThe standards-trackshadowrootmodeattribute, which enables declarative Shadow DOM, was shipped in Chrome 111 (ChromeStatus). The older, non-standardshadowrootattribute is now deprecated. During the deprecation period, both attributes are functional, however the shadowroot attribute does not enable the new streaming behavior, whereasshadowrootmodeallows streaming of content. There is a straightforward migration path: replaceshadowrootwithshadowrootmode.The oldshadowrootattribute is deprecated as of Chrome 112, and it will be removed (no longer supported) in Chrome 119. Chrome 119 goes to Stable on October 31, 2023.Chrome 119 on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android

- Shifting UI strings in Chrome fromCleartoDeletewhen getting rid of dataChrome is updating settings text to reflectdeleteinstead ofclearwhen referring to the destruction of data. We expect this change to improve users’ understanding of the associated effect on data. Users who intend to get rid of data should feel reassured that the data is actuallydeleted,not justclearedfrom one view but possibly accessible elsewhere.Chrome 119 on Android, iOS, ChromeOS, Mac, Windows:The earliest milestone that users may see these changes is 119.

- DevTools internal errors reported to Chrome internal crash reportingTo improve Chrome's stability, DevTools internal errors are now reported through Chrome's existing crash reporting pipeline. This provides visibility of the stability of Chrome DevTools. Admins can control all crash reporting, including these errors, using theMetricsReportingEnabledenterprise policy.Chrome 119 on ChromeOS, Linux

- Chrome 119 on ChromeOS, Linux





- Skip unload eventsThe presence of unload event listeners is a primary blocker forback/forward cacheon Chromium based browsers and for Firefox on desktop platforms. On the other hand, for mobile platforms, almost all browsers prioritize thebfcacheby not firing unload events in most cases. To improve the situation, we’ve been working with lots of partners and successfully reduced the use of unload event listeners over the last few years. To further accelerate this migration, weproposeto have Chrome for desktop gradually skip unload events.In case you need more time tomigrate away from unload events, we’ll offer temporary opt-outs in the form of a Permissions-Policy API and an enterprise policyForcePermissionPolicyUnloadDefaultEnabled, which will allow you to selectively keep the behavior unchanged.Chrome 117 on Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, Windows: Dev TrialChrome 119 on Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, Windows:IntroducesForcePermissionPolicyUnloadDefaultEnabledpolicyChrome 120-131 on Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, Windows:Deprecation trial(general rollout of deprecation will be limited scope until deprecation trial is ready)

- Remove Authorization header upon cross-origin redirectTheFetchstandard has been updated to remove Authorization header on cross origin redirects. Chrome 119 implements this change to the specification. Prior to Chrome 119, when a cross origin redirect, such as fromfoo.testtobar.test, happened with an Authorization header, Chrome preserved the Authorization header andbar.testcould receive the header. Starting Chrome 119, Chrome removes Authorization headers when cross origin redirects happen, meaning thatbar.testno longer receives the Authorization header.Chrome 119 on ChromeOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, Android

- Dedicated setting for Permission Suggestions ServiceThe settings page for notification and geolocation permissions now has an additional option to explicitly enable the Permission Suggestions Service. Permission Suggestions Service is an already existing feature, but it didn’t have its dedicated setting. It was tied to standard Safe Browsing settings being enabled. Now the users can choose between four different states:Always show the notification/geolocation permission promptLet Permission Suggestion Service quieten unwanted notification/geolocation requests (new)Always quieten notification permission requestsAlways block notifications/geolocation permission requestsAdmins can use the existing policies to either always allow or always block notifications or geolocation requests globally or for particular sites.DefaultNotificationsSettingNotificationsAllowedForUrlsandNotificationsBlockedForUrlsDefaultGeolocationSettingChrome 119 on Linux, Mac, Windows

- Hash-prefix real-time lookupsFor standard Safe Browsing protection users, visited URLs now have their safety checked in real time instead of against a less frequently updated local list of unsafe URLs. This is done by sending partial hashes of the URLs to Google Safe Browsing through a proxy via Oblivious HTTP, so that the user’s IP address is not linked to the partial hashes. This change improves security while maintaining privacy for users. If needed, the feature can be disabled through the policySafeBrowsingProxiedRealTimeChecksAllowed.Chrome 119 on Android, iOS, Chrome OS, LaCrOS, Linux, Mac, Windows

- Remove recommended support from multiple policiesSome policies can be applied as recommended, allowing administrators to set an initial value which end-users can later change. Beginning in Chrome 119, recommended support will be removed from multiple policies which end-users currently have no way of configuring.Any affected policies that were previously set as recommended will need to be set as mandatory to ensure they continue to take effect.Chrome 119 on Linux, Mac, Windows:Recommended support is being removed from thePrintPdfAsImageDefaultenterprise policy.Chrome 120 on Android, Linux, Mac, Windows: Recommended support is being removed from the following enterprise policies:AlternateErrorPagesEnabledPasswordDismissCompromisedAlertEnabledPasswordLeakDetectionEnabledSafeBrowsingForTrustedSourcesEnabled

- Default Search Engine choice screenAs early as Chrome 120, enterprise end-users might be prompted to choose their default search engine within Chrome.As part of our building forDMA compliance, some users will be prompted to choose their default search engine for Chrome. This prompt controls the default search engine setting, currently available at chrome://settings/search. The enterprise policies,DefaultSearchProviderEnabledandDefaultSearchProviderSearchUrl, will continue to control this setting as it does today, if it is set by the IT admin.

- Chrome Third-Party Cookie deprecationIn Chrome 120 and beyond (Jan 2024), Chrome will globally disable third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome traffic as part of ourChrome-facilitated testingin collaboration with theCMA. This will allow sites to meaningfully preview what it's like to operate in a world without third-party cookies. Most enterprise users will be excluded from this experiment group automatically. But for the few that might be affected, admins will be able to use theBlockThirdPartyCookiesandCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicies to re-enable third-party cookies and opt out their managed browsers ahead of the experiment. This will give enterprises time to make the changes required to not rely on this policy or third-party cookies.We plan to provide more tooling to help identify third-party cookies use cases. Admins can set theBlockThirdPartyCookies policyto false to re-enable third-party cookies for all sites but this will prevent users from changing the corresponding setting in Chrome. Alternatively, to prevent breakage, you can set theCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicy to allowlist your enterprise applications to continue receiving third-party cookies.For more details on how to prepare, provide feedback and report potential site issues, refer to theMode B: 1% third-party cookie deprecationblog sectionand thePreparing for the end of third-party cookiesblog.Chrome 120 on ChromeOS, Linux, Mac, Windows1% of global traffic has third-party cookies disabled.

- Network Service on Windows will be sandboxedTo improve security and reliability, the network service, already running in its own process, will be sandboxed on Windows. As part of this, third-party code that is currently able to tamper with the network service may be prevented from doing so. This might cause interoperability issues with software that injects code into Chrome's process space, such as Data Loss Prevention software. TheNetworkServiceSandboxEnabledpolicy allows you to disable the sandbox if incompatibilities are discovered. You can test the sandbox in your environment usingtheseinstructions andreportany issues you encounter.Chrome 120 on Windows:Network Service sandboxed on Windows

- Migrate away from data URLs in SVGUseElementThe SVG spec was recently updated to remove support for data: URLs inSVGUseElement. This improves security of the Web platform as well as compatibility between browsers as Webkit does not support data: URLs inSVGUseElement. You can read more inthisblog post.Assigning a data: URL inSVGUseElementcan cause XSS. And this also led to a Trusted Types bypass.For enterprises that need additional time to migrate, theDataUrlInSvgUseEnabledpolicy will be available until Chrome 128 to re-enable Data URL support forSVGUseElement.Chrome 120 on Android, ChromeOS, LaCrOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Fuchsia:Remove support for data: URLs in SVGUseElement

- Permissions prompt for Web MIDI APIThere have beenseveral reported problemsaround Web MIDI API's drive-by access to client MIDI devices (bugs). To address this problem, the Audio WG decided to place an explicit permission on the generalMIDI API access. Originally, the explicit permission was only required for the advanced MIDI usage, for example,  system exclusive (SysEx) message in Chrome, with gated access behind a permissions prompt. We plan to  expand the scope of the permission to regular MIDI API usage.Today the use of SysEx messages with the Web MIDI API requires an explicit user permission. With this implementation, even access to the Web MIDI API without SysEx support will require a user permission. Three new policies—DefaultMidiSetting, MidiAllowedForUrlsandMidiBlockedForUrls—will be available to allow administrators to pre-configure user access to the API.Chrome 121 on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android

- IP Protection Phase 0 for ChromeAs early as Chrome 122, Chrome might route traffic for some network requests to Google-owned resources through a privacy proxy. This is an early milestone in a larger effort to protect users' identities by masking their IP address from known cross-site trackers. More information is available in thisexplaineron GitHub. Enterprise policies will be in place to allow admins to turn off the feature before it’s launched.Chrome 122 on ChromeOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Android

- Apps & Extensions Usage report: Highlight extensions removed from the Chrome Web StoreAs early as 122, Chrome is adding new information on the Apps & Extensions Usage Report to help you identify if an extension was recently removed from the Chrome Web Store. On the App Details page, you can find the reason why an extension was removed from the Chrome Web Store. This feature will help IT administrators identify the impact of using the policy to disable unpublished extensions.Chrome 122 on LaCrOS, Linux, Mac, Windows

- Legacy Technology reportAs early as Chrome 122, the Legacy Technology report will be available in the Admin console and it will proactively report websites (both internal and external) that are using technology that will be deprecated, for example, SameSite cookie changes, or older security protocols like TLS 1.0/1.1. This gives admins the ability to work with developers to plan required tech migrations before the deprecation goes into effect.  If you’re interested in helping us test this feature, you can sign up for our Trusted Tester programhere.Chrome 122 on LaCrOS, Linux, Mac, Windows

- Intent to deprecate: Mutation EventsSynchronous Mutation Events, includingDOMSubtreeModified,DOMNodeInserted,DOMNodeRemoved,DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument,DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument, andDOMCharacterDataModified, negatively affect page performance, and also significantly increase the complexity of adding new features to the Web. These APIs were deprecated from the spec in 2011, and were replaced (in 2012) by the much better-behaved Mutation Observer API. Usage of the obsolete Mutation Events must be removed or migrated to Mutation Observer.Chrome 127 on Android, ChromeOS, Linux, Mac, Windows:Mutation Events will stop functioning in Chrome 127, around July 30, 2024.

- Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3. Chrome extensions are transitioning to a new manifest version, Manifest V3. This will bring improved privacy for your users—for example, by moving to a model where extensions modify requests declaratively, without the ability to see individual requests. This also improves extension security, as remotely hosted code will be disallowed on Manifest V3. As mentioned earlier in ourblog post, the Manifest V2 deprecation timelines are under review and the experiments scheduled for early 2023 are being postponed. During the timeline review, existing Manifest V2 extensions can still be updated, and still run in Chrome. However, all new extensions submitted to the Chrome Web Store must implement Manifest V3. An Enterprise policyExtensionManifestV2Availabilityis available to control whether Manifest v2 extensions are allowed. The policy can be used to test Manifest V3 in your organization ahead of the migration. You can see which Manifest version is being used by all Chrome extensions running on your fleet using the Apps & extensions usage page in Chrome Browser Cloud Management. Read more on theManifest timeline, including:Chrome 98 on ChromeOS, LaCrOS, Linux, Mac, Windows: Chrome Web Store stops accepting new Manifest V2 extensions with visibility set to "Public" or "Unlisted".

#### Upcoming ChromeOS changes





- Set the screensaver durationAs early as ChromeOS 120, you will be able to set the duration for screensaver while charging. Users can now choose how long their screensaver runs while their device is charging (not on battery). You can control this using a new enterprise policy. The default setting is Forever, and can be reduced using drop-down options.





- New controls for mouse scroll accelerationChromeOS 120 will add new controls to let users disable mouse scroll acceleration and adjust the speed of the scrolling.





- EnhancedAlt + clickbehaviorIn ChromeOS 120, you will be able to configure right-click behavior using the keyboard and touchpad. You can also configure settings for actions such as Home, End, and Page Up, in theCustomize keyboard keyssubpage.





- New look for ChromeOS media playerAs early as ChromeOS 121, the media player will have bigger buttons and colors to match your wallpaper. The media player will appear when you are playing any video or audio (like Spotify or YouTube) in Quick Settings. You will be able to click the pin icon to move the media player to the shelf. In addition to controlling media that is being cast, you will be able to start casting web media to any speakers or screens on your local network.





- Enhanced notifications for pinned appsAs early as ChromeOS 121, you will be able to visually separate pinned notifications from other notifications. We will change the visual specs, buttons, and notification text to fit within fixed size bubbles. This significantly differentiates the visual look of pinned notifications from typical notifications to reflect their significant difference in purpose (notifying the user of an ongoing process rather than an instantaneous event).





- New ChromeOS sync optionsChromeOS will soon deliver an updated device setup experience that lets users customize sync settings for apps, settings, wi-fi networks, and wallpaper.





- App disablement by Admin in MGSUp until now, Managed Guest Sessions (MGS) include a set of applications (Explore, Gallery, and Terminal apps) that are available to the user. With theSystemFeaturesDisableListpolicy, Admins will soon be able to disable these apps, blocking and hiding them from users across your enterprise.

#### Upcoming ChromeOS changes

## Chrome browser updates





- Remove ForceMajorVersionToMinorPositionInUserAgent policyChrome 118 removes theForceMajorVersionToMinorPositionInUserAgentpolicy. This policy was introduced in Chrome 99 to control whether the User-Agent string major version would be frozen at 99, in case of User-Agent string parsing bugs when the version changed to 100. Fortunately, we did not need to deploy this feature and only encountered a few minor 3-digit version parsing issues that have all since been fixed. Given that, we can now remove this policy. If you have any feedback about this policy removal, or are aware of intranet functionality that depends on the policy, comment onthisbug.Chrome 118 on Android, ChromeOS, Linux, Mac, Windows:RemoveForceMajorVersionToMinorPositionInUserAgentpolicy

- Remotely disable malicious off-store extensionsWhen Enhanced Safe Browsing is enabled, where users have a malicious off-store extension installed,  the extension is disabled when the decision is entered on the Safe Browsing servers via either manually or by an automated detection system.Chrome 118 on ChromeOS, Linux, Mac, Windows:Feature launches
- Chrome 118 on ChromeOS, Linux, Mac, Windows:Feature launches


- Chrome 118 on ChromeOS, Linux, Mac, Windows:Feature launches





- Remove RendererCodeIntegrityEnabled policyThe Renderer Code Integrity security feature is no longer controlled by theRendererCodeIntegrityEnabledpolicy; it is now switched on by default. We recommend that you verify any potential incompatibilities with third party software by no longer using the policy in advance of this release. To report any issues you encounter, submit a bughere.Chrome 118 on Windows:This policy is deprecated and will no longer take effect
- Chrome 118 on Windows:This policy is deprecated and will no longer take effect


- Chrome 118 on Windows:This policy is deprecated and will no longer take effect





- Support for passkeys in iCloud Keychain on macOSChrome on macOS ≥ 13.5 now supports creating and using passkeys from iCloud Keychain. When signing in using WebAuthn, passkeys from iCloud Keychain are listed as options once the user has granted Chrome the needed permission. If permission has not been granted, a genericiCloud Keychainoption appears that prompts for permission before showing iCloud Keychain passkeys. If permission is denied, the iCloud Keychain can still be used, but it has to be manually selected each time.When a site asks to create a platform passkey, Chrome might default to creating the passkey in iCloud Keychain based on whether iCloud Drive is in use and whether WebAuthn credentials from the current profile have been recently used. This can be controlled with a setting on chrome://password-manager/settings, and with the enterprise policyCreatePasskeysInICloudKeychain.Chrome 118 on Mac:Chrome 118 supports iCloud Keychain. Whether Chrome defaults to creating platform passkeys in iCloud Keychain can be altered by Chrome Variations during the lifetime of 118.
- Chrome 118 on Mac:Chrome 118 supports iCloud Keychain. Whether Chrome defaults to creating platform passkeys in iCloud Keychain can be altered by Chrome Variations during the lifetime of 118.


- Chrome 118 on Mac:Chrome 118 supports iCloud Keychain. Whether Chrome defaults to creating platform passkeys in iCloud Keychain can be altered by Chrome Variations during the lifetime of 118.





- Hash-prefix real-time lookupsFor standard Safe Browsing protection users, visited URLs now have their safety checked in real time, instead of less frequently using an updated local list of unsafe URLs. This is done by sending partial hashes of the URLs to Google Safe Browsing through a proxy viaOblivious HTTP, so that the user’s IP address is not linked to the partial hashes. This change improves security while maintaining privacy for users. If needed, you can control this feature using theSafeBrowsingProxiedRealTimeChecksAllowedpolicy.Chrome 118 on iOS, ChromeOS, LaCrOS, Linux, Mac, Windows

- Chrome 118 on iOS, ChromeOS, LaCrOS, Linux, Mac, Windows





- Updates to the red Safe Browsing interstitialsIn Chrome 118, users see minor updates to the red Safe Browsing interstitials. The main body text now includes an explicit recommendation from Chrome and site ID is specified in the details section instead of the main body. The danger icon replaces the previous warning icon, and styling is now consistent with the latest product standards. These changes improve user comprehension of warnings.Chrome 118 on Android, iOS, ChromeOS, LaCrOS, Linux, Mac, Windows

- Chrome 118 on Android, iOS, ChromeOS, LaCrOS, Linux, Mac, Windows





- Form controls support vertical writing modeThe CSS property writing-mode should be enabled for form controls elements as it allows lines of text to be laid out horizontally or vertically and it sets the direction in which blocks progress.With this feature, we are allowing the form control elements select, meter, progress, button, textarea and input to have vertical-rl or vertical-lr writing mode. As needed for Web compatibility, we now begin to slowly roll out the change for a number of form controls in 118, and we will continue in future milestones.You can control this feature with the following command line flags:--enable-features= FormControlsVerticalWritingModeSupport--enable-features= FormControlsVerticalWritingModeTextSupportChrome 118 on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android
- Chrome 118 on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android


- Chrome 118 on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android





- Block all cookies set via JavaScript that contain control charactersUpdates how control characters in cookies set via JavaScript are handled. Specifically, all control characters cause the entire cookie to be rejected (previously a NULL character, a carriage return character, or a line feed character in a cookie line caused it to be truncated instead of rejected entirely, which could have enabled malicious behavior in certain circumstances). This behavior aligns Chrome with the behavior indicated by thelatest drafts of RFC6265bis.You can control this feature  using the --disable-features=BlockTruncatedCookies or theBlockTruncatedCookiesenterprise policy, which will be available for several milestones in case this change causes any breakage.Chrome 118 on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android
- Chrome 118 on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android


- Chrome 118 on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android





- Clearer Safe Browsing protection level settings text and imagesIn Chrome 118, some users see new text describing the Safe Browsing protection level on both the Security Settings page and the Privacy Guide. The update clarifies the Enhanced Protection level by adding a table and linking to a help center article where users can learn more. The new table helps users understand the trade-offs when selecting that option versus choosing the other options. The descriptions for Standard Protection, No Protection and the password compromise warnings toggle have been simplified to make the options clearer. The Safe Browsing protection level is an existing feature, still controlled by theSafeBrowsingProtectionLevelpolicy.Chrome 118:Some users see the updated text and images on the Chrome Security Settings page and on the Privacy Guide.
- Chrome 118:Some users see the updated text and images on the Chrome Security Settings page and on the Privacy Guide.

- WebUSB in Extension Service WorkersWeb developers can use the WebUSB API when responding to extension events by exposing WebUSB API to Service Workers registered by browser extensions. This API is not yet exposed to Service Workers registered by sites but the implementation experience gained by supporting the API for extensions will be valuable for such a future project.Chrome 118 on Windows, Mac, Linux, ChromeOS
- Chrome 118 on Windows, Mac, Linux, ChromeOS


- Chrome 118 on Windows, Mac, Linux, ChromeOS





- Include chrome.tabs API calls in extension telemetry reportsWhen you switch on Enhanced Safe Browsing, Chrome now collects telemetry information about chrome.tabs API calls made by extensions. This information is analyzed on Google servers and further improves the detection of malicious and policy violating extensions. It also allows better protection for all Chrome extension users. You can turn off this functionality along with the extension telemetry feature by settingSafeBrowsingProtectionLevelto any value other than 2, which turns off Enhanced Safe Browsing.Chrome 118 on ChromeOS, Linux, Mac, Windows:Feature launches
- Chrome 118 on ChromeOS, Linux, Mac, Windows:Feature launches


- Chrome 118 on ChromeOS, Linux, Mac, Windows:Feature launches





- Remove non-standard appearance keywordsSince only standard appearance keywords should be supported, Chrome 118 removes appearance (and -webkit-appearance) keywords, including:* inner-spin-button* media-slider* media-sliderthumb* media-volume-slider* media-volume-sliderthumb* push-button* searchfield-cancel-button* slider-horizontal* sliderthumb-horizontal* sliderthumb-vertical* square-buttonNote that value slider-vertical will not be removed as part of this patch; it is used for allowing <input type=range> vertical.

- Enrollment for Privacy SandboxAs the Privacy Sandbox relevance and measurement APIs start ramping up for general availability, we want to make sure these technologies are used as intended and with transparency. The APIs include Attribution Reporting, the Protected Audience API, Topics, Private Aggregation and Shared Storage. Privacy Sandbox is introducing a newDeveloper Enrollment processfor Privacy Sandbox relevance and measurement APIs. Chrome will fetch the enrolled-sites list from the enrollment server (via component updater) and use it to gate access to the Privacy Sandbox APIs.Chrome 118 on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android

- Encrypted archive deep scanning for Enhanced Safe Browsing usersGoogle Chrome offers deep scanning of some suspicious downloads to users who have opted in to Enhanced Safe Browsing. This sends the file content to Safe Browsing for a real-time evaluation of the file's safety. Starting in Chrome 118, deep scans of encrypted archives, for example, ZIP and RAR files, prompt the user to provide the archive password along with the file content. This is necessary for Safe Browsing to provide a useful verdict about the contents of the archive. Enterprises who do not want to see this prompt can prevent users from enabling Enhanced Safe Browsing with theSafeBrowsingProtectionLevelpolicy. Starting in Chrome 119, enterprises who want to switch off file deep scans while still enabling Enhanced Safe Browsing can do so with theSafeBrowsingDeepScanningEnabledpolicy.Chrome 118 on ChromeOS, LaCrOS, Linux, Mac, Windows

- TLS Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)The TLS Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) extension allows clients to encrypt ClientHello messages, which are normally sent in cleartext, under a server’s public key. This allows websites to opt-in to avoid leaking sensitive fields, like the server name, to the network by hosting a special HTTPS RR DNS record. (Earlier iterations of this extension were called Encrypted Server Name Indication, or ESNI.) If your organization’s infrastructure relies on the ability to inspect SNI, for example, filtering, logging, and so on, you should test it. You can enable the new behavior by navigating tochrome://flagsand enabling the#encrypted-client-helloflag. If you notice any incompatibilities, you can use theEncryptedClientHelloEnabledenterprise policy to disable support for ECH.Chrome 118 on Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, Windows:Rolled out to 100% of users

- Password recoveryChromeOS users who have forgotten their password can now recover their account along with all associated local data. Gone are the days where all local data is lost when a password has been forgotten! You can control this feature with theRecoveryFactorBehaviorpolicy.





- Tabbed PWAsDevelopers can now choose to display their Progressive Web App (PWA) intabbedmode, allowing users to manage and navigate multiple documents within a single window using a familiar tab strip. Developers should also specify a home tab where appropriate, which provides a consistent place for users to access documents and settings.





- Printer setup assistanceTo simplify a user's printing journey, ChromeOS provides more in context help when it comes to using their printer: an easier way to save printers, new set up instructions and help content, printer status directly integrated on the settings page. Moreover, we now also provide users an easy route to manage their printer when they face issues with it while trying to print.





- Imprivata integration v4For caregivers,Imprivata OneSigncompatibility with Google ChromeOS devices and the Chrome browser means fast, secure access, and better cost efficiency. This fourth version of Imprivata integration,  Imprivata v4, adds deployment, stability, and workflow improvements. It improves support for assigned devices by allowing for Imprivata sign-in to ChromeOS user sessions. In addition, ChromeOS 118 now supports all 12 languages of Imprivata and SPINE workflows.





- Touch text editing redesignImproved text editing interaction with user's fingers on the touchscreen, including a much more intuitive gesture system, usability improvements around gesture intentions and text legibility, a brand new magnifier that automatically shows cursor position with precision.

- Deprecate and remove WebSQLThe Web SQL Database standard was first proposed in April 2009 and abandoned in November 2010. Gecko never implemented this feature and WebKit deprecated this feature in 2019. The W3C encouraged those needing web databases to adopt Web Storage or Indexed Database.Ever since its release, it has made it incredibly difficult to keep our users secure. SQLite was not initially designed to run malicious SQL statements, and yet with WebsQL we have to do exactly this. Having to react to a flow of stability and security issues is an unpredictable cost to the storage team. With SQLite over WASM as its official replacement, we want to remove WebSQL entirely.Chrome 115: Deprecation message added to console.Chrome 117: In Chrome 117, the WebSQL Deprecation Trial starts. The trial ends in Chrome 123. During the trial period, a policy,WebSQLAccess, is needed for the feature to be available.Chrome 119:Starting with Chrome 119, WebSQL is no longer available.

- Network Service on Windows will be sandboxedTo improve security and reliability, the network service, already running in its own process, will be sandboxed on Windows. As part of this, third-party code that is currently able to tamper with the network service may be prevented from doing so. This might cause interoperability issues with software that injects code into Chrome's process space, such as Data Loss Prevention software. TheNetworkServiceSandboxEnabledpolicy allows you to disable the sandbox if incompatibilities are discovered.

- Remove Sanitizer APITheSanitizer APIaims to build an easy-to-use, always secure, browser-maintained HTML sanitizer into the platform. We shipped an initial version of the Sanitizer API in Chrome 105, based on the then-current specification draft. However, the standards discussion has meanwhile moved on and the proposed API shape has changed substantially. To prevent the current API from becoming entrenched, we plan to remove the current implementation. We expect to re-implement the Sanitizer API when the proposed specification stabilizes again.Chrome 119 on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android

- Private Aggregation API bundled enhancementsWe're planning a few bundled changes to Private Aggregation:-Null report fixes:Currently reports with no contributions are inadvertently dropped. This change ensures that, when a context ID is specified, a null report is sent even if budget is denied. Separately, it fixes a bug causing budget to always be denied for null reports.-Debug mode eligibility changes:Currently, debug mode is always available. This change only allows debug mode for callers that are allowed access to third-party cookies, silently dropping the debug mode otherwise. Note that this will allow debug mode to automatically sunset when third-party cookies are deprecated.-Padding report payloads:To avoid the payload size being dependent on the number of contributions, we will pad it with 'null' contributions to a fixed length. Note that this change will also affect Attribution Reporting reports.-Reducing delay:When a context ID is specified, we remove the randomized 10-60 minute delay, which is superfluous as a report is always sent in this case. Instead, we just wait until the Shared Storage operation timeout.Chrome 119 on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android

- Chrome Third-Party Cookie Deprecation (3PCD)In Chrome 120 and beyond (Jan 2024), Chrome will globally disable third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome traffic as part of ourChrome-facilitated testingin collaboration with theCMA, to allow sites to meaningfully preview what it's like to operate in a world without third-party cookies (3PCs). Most enterprise end users will be excluded from this experiment group automatically. But for the few that may be affected, enterprise admins will be able to utilize an enterprise policy to opt out their managed browsers ahead of the experiment and give enterprises time to make necessary changes to not rely on this policy or third party cookies.We plan to provide more details about this policy and provide more tooling to help identify 3PC use cases. In the meantime, refer to theMode B: 1% third-party cookie deprecationblog sectionfor more details on how to prepare, provide feedback and report potential site issues.Chrome 120 on ChromeOS, Linux, Mac, Windows1% of global traffic has third party cookies disabled.

- Intent to deprecate: Mutation EventsSynchronous Mutation Events, including DOMSubtreeModified, DOMNodeInserted, DOMNodeRemoved, DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument, DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument, and DOMCharacterDataModified, negatively affect page performance, and also significantly increase the complexity of adding new features to the Web. These APIs were deprecated from the spec in 2011, and were replaced (in 2012) by the much better-behaved Mutation Observer API.

- Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3. Chrome extensions are transitioning to a new manifest version, Manifest V3. This will bring improved privacy for your users—for example, by moving to a model where extensions modify requests declaratively, without the ability to see individual requests. This also improves extension security, as remotely hosted code will be disallowed on Manifest V3. As mentioned earlier in ourblog post, the Manifest V2 deprecation timelines are under review and the experiments scheduled for early 2023 are being postponed. During the timeline review, existing Manifest V2 extensions can still be updated, and still run in Chrome. However, all new extensions submitted to the Chrome Web Store must implement Manifest V3.

## Chrome browser updates





- Skip unload eventsThe presence of unload event listeners is a primary blocker forback/forward cacheon Chromium based browsers and for Firefox on desktop platforms. On the other hand, for mobile platforms, almost all browsers prioritize thebfcacheby not firing unload events in most cases. To improve the situation, we’ve been working with lots of partners and successfully reduced the use of unload event listeners over the last few years. To further accelerate this migration, weproposeto have Chrome for desktop gradually skip unload events. In case you need more time to migrate away from unload events, we’ll offer temporary opt-outs in the form of an API and a group policy, which will allow you to selectively keep the behavior unchanged.Chrome 117 on Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, Windows:Dev Trial.

- Chrome no longer supports macOS 10.13 and macOS 10.14Chrome will no longer support macOS 10.13 and macOS 10.14, which are already outside of their support window with Apple. Users have to update their operating systems in order to continue running Chrome browser. Running on a supported operating system is essential to maintaining security. If run on macOS 10.13 or 10.14, Chrome continues to show an infobar that reminds users that Chrome 117 will no longer support macOS 10.13 and macOS 10.14.Chrome 117 on Mac:Chrome no longer supports macOS 10.13 and macOS 10.14.
- Chrome 117 on Mac:Chrome no longer supports macOS 10.13 and macOS 10.14.

- Update to lock iconWe plan to replace the lock icon with a variant of the tune icon, which is commonly used to indicate controls and settings. Replacing the lock icon with a neutral indicator prevents the misunderstanding that the lock icon is associated with the trustworthiness of a page, and emphasizes that security should be the default state in Chrome. Our research has also shown that many users never understood that clicking the lock icon showed important information and controls. We think the new icon helps make permission controls and additional security information more accessible, while avoiding the misunderstandings that plague the lock icon.The new icon is scheduled to launch as part of a general design refresh for desktop platforms. Chrome will continue to alert users when their connection is not secure. You can enable the tune icon pre-release in Chrome for Desktop if you enable Chrome Refresh 2023 atchrome://flags#chrome-refresh-2023, but keep in mind this flag enables work that is still actively in-progress and under development, and does not represent a final product.We will also replace the icon on Android. On iOS, the lock icon is not tappable, so we will be removing the icon. You can read more inthisblog post.Chrome 117 on Linux, Mac, Windows:The new icon is scheduled to launch in Chrome 117.

- Network service is sandboxed on Linux and ChromeOSThe network service is sandboxed on Linux and ChromeOS to improve security. On Linux, it's possible that third party software (likely data loss prevention or antivirus software) is injecting code into Chrome's processes and will be blocked by this change. This may result in Chrome crashing for your users.If this happens, you should work with the vendor of the third party software to stop it from injecting code into Chrome's processes. In the meantime, you will be able to use theNetworkServiceSandboxEnabledpolicy to defer the sandboxing. This is a temporary measure intended to help enterprises surprised by the change; the policy will be removed in a future version of Chrome.Chrome 117 on Chrome OS, Linux:The network service sandboxed on Linux and ChromeOS to improve security.

- TLS Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)The TLS Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) extension enables clients to encrypt ClientHello messages, which are normally sent in cleartext, under a server’s public key. This allows websites to opt-in to avoid leaking sensitive fields, like the server name, to the network by hosting a special HTTPS RR DNS record. (Earlier iterations of this extension were called Encrypted Server Name Indication, or ESNI.) If your organization’s infrastructure relies on the ability to inspect SNI, for example, filtering, logging, and so on, you should test it. You can enable the new behavior by navigating tochrome://flagsand enabling the#encrypted-client-helloflag. On Windows and Linux, you also need to enable Secure DNS for the flag to have an effect.If you notice any incompatibilities, you can use theEncryptedClientHelloEnabledenterprise policy to disable support for ECH.Chrome 117 on Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, Windows
- Chrome 117 on Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, Windows


- Chrome 117 on Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, Windows





- User surveys related to SafeBrowsing warningsAfter a user adheres to or bypasses a SafeBrowsing warning, Chrome may ask them about their satisfaction with the experience. You can control this with theSafeBrowsingSurveysEnabledpolicy.Chrome 117 on Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, Windows
- Chrome 117 on Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, Windows


- Chrome 117 on Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, Windows





- Simplified onboarding experienceSome users may see a simplified onboarding experience with a more intuitive way to sign into Chrome. Enterprise policies likeBrowserSignin,SyncDisabled,EnableSyncConsent,RestrictSigninToPatternandSyncTypesListDisabledwill continue to be available as before to control whether the user can sign into Chrome and turn on sync. ThePromotionalTabsEnabledpolicy can be used to skip the onboarding altogether. DefaultBrowserSettingEnabled is respected in the same way as before.Chrome 117 on Linux, Mac, Windows

- Chrome 117 on Linux, Mac, Windows





- Warnings on insecure downloadsChrome will begin showing warnings on some downloads if those files were downloaded over an insecure (i.e. not HTTPS) connection. These warnings do not prevent downloading and can be bypassed by the user. Enterprises can test their downloads by enabling warnings viachrome://flags/#insecure-download-warnings. Enterprises can also disable warnings for sites that can not deliver files securely by adding the downloading site toInsecureContentAllowedForUrls.Chrome 117 on Android, Chrome OS, LaCrOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Fuchsia:Chrome shows warnings on some downloads.

- Service Worker static routing APIChrome releases the Service Worker static routing API; it enables developers to optimize how Service Workers are loaded. Specifically, it allows developers to configure the routing, and allows them to offload simple things ServiceWorkers do. If the condition matches, the navigation happens without starting ServiceWorkers or executing JavaScript, which allows web pages to avoid performance penalties due to ServiceWorker interceptions.Chrome 116 on Android, Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, Windows: Origin Trial for Service Worker static routing API.Chrome 117 on Android, Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, Windows:Release of the Service Worker static routing API.

- Chrome browser integration with Symantec Endpoint DLPThis feature provides a secure native integration that transfers content (file or text) between Chrome and Broadcom’s Symantec DLP agent without the need for deploying an extension. When a CBCM or CDM managed user performs an action that sends data via Chrome, Symantec Endpoint DLP can monitor for data exfiltration and apply allow/block controls based on customer's DLP policies.Chrome 117 on Windows
- Chrome 117 on Windows


- Chrome 117 on Windows





- Require X.509 key usage extension for RSA certificates chaining to local rootsX.509 certificates used for HTTPS should contain a key usage extension that declares how the key in a certificate may be used. Such instructions ensure certificates are not used in an unintended context, which protects against a class of cross-protocol attacks on HTTPS and other protocols. For this to work, HTTPS clients must check that server certificates match the connection's TLS parameters, specifically that the key usage flag for “digitalSignature” and possibly “keyEncipherment” (depending on TLS ciphers in use) are asserted when using RSA.Chrome 117 will begin enforcing that the key usage extension is set properly on RSA certificates chaining to local roots. Key usage is already required for ECDSA certificates, and for publicly trusted certificates. Enterprises can test and temporarily disable key usage enforcement using theRSAKeyUsageForLocalAnchorsEnabledpolicy (available in Chrome 116).Chrome 116 on Android, Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, Windows: TheRSAKeyUsageForLocalAnchorsEnabledpolicy is added.Chrome 117 on Android, Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, Windows:Chrome begins enforcing that the key usage extension is set properly on RSA certificates chaining to local roots.

- Simplified sign-in and sync experienceChrome launches a simplified and consolidated version of sign-in and sync in Chrome. Chrome sync will no longer be shown as a separate feature in settings or elsewhere. Instead, users can sign in to Chrome to use and save information like passwords, bookmarks and more in their Google Account, subject to the relevant enterprise policies.  As before, the functionality previously part of Chrome sync that saves and accesses Chrome data in the Google Account can be turned off fully (viaSyncDisabled) or partially (viaSyncTypesListDisabled). Sign-in to Chrome can be required or disabled viaBrowserSigninas before.Note that the changes do not affect users’ ability to sign in to Google services on the web (like Gmail) without signing in to Chrome, their ability to stay signed out of Chrome, or their ability to control what information is synced with their Google Account.Chrome 117 on iOS:Simplified sign-in and sync experience launches on iOS.

- Allow users to review and optionally remove potentially unsafe extensionsA new review panel will be added inchrome://extensions, which appears whenever there are potentially unsafe extensions that need the user's attention, such as extensions that are malware, policy violating or are no longer available in the Chrome Web Store. The user can choose to remove or keep these extensions.There is also a count of risky extensions needing review that is presented in the Chrome Privacy & Security settings page. As an administrator, you can preemptively control the availability of potentially unsafe extensions using theExtensionUnpublishedAvailabilitypolicy.Chrome 117 on Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, Windows

- Deprecate and remove WebSQLThe Web SQL Database standard was first proposed in April 2009 and abandoned in November 2010. Gecko never implemented this feature and WebKit deprecated this feature in 2019. The W3C encouraged those needing web databases to adopt Web Storage or Indexed Database. Ever since its release, it has made it incredibly difficult to keep our users secure. SQLite was not initially designed to run malicious SQL statements, and yet with WebsQL we have to do exactly this. Having to react to a flow of stability and security issues is an unpredictable cost to the storage team. With SQLite over WASM as its official replacement, we want to remove WebSQL entirely.Chrome 115: Deprecation message added to console.Chrome 117:In Chrome 117 the WebSQL Deprecation Trial starts. The trial ends in Chrome 123. During the trial period, a policy,WebSQLAccess, is needed for the feature to be available.Chrome 119: Starting Chrome 119, WebSQL is no longer available.

- Avoid content control escapes on the login or lock screenAdministrators can now control and limit the available content on end-users login and lock screens when identity federation is used with a third party identity provider (using SAML or OIDC). This is achieved by introducing two new policies to block or allow external URLs on login and lock screens,DeviceAuthenticationURLAllowlistandDeviceAuthenticationURLBlocklist. As a result, you can prevent content control escapes.





- Emoji Picker with GIF supportThe emoji picker now supports GIFs. Search and find the perfect GIF to express yourself.For managed devices, this feature is switched off by default.

You can control the new look using the ChromeOS Personalization App.





- ChromeOS Personalization AppWith this launch, your ChromeOS now has accent colors that match your wallpapers, creating a unique theme for your device. The accent colors also adapt to the light and dark modes.





- Color correction settings on ChromeOSChromeOS now has built-in color correction settings that make it easier for users to see colors on their screens. In ChromeOS Accessibility settings, under Display and Magnification, you can enable color filters for protanopia, deuteranopia or tritanopia, or to view the display in grayscale. Users can use a slider to customize the filters' intensity to meet their needs.





- System answer cards in Launcher searchWhen users search for the status of their OS version, battery, RAM, storage, or CPU, in Launcher, they can now see that information previewed in the search results.








- Nudge managed users towards enrolling non-ZTE devicesThis feature enables administrators to demand managed users to enroll their non-zero touch devices by introducing a new user policy,UserEnrollmentNudging, which can be configured to require enrollment of the given user. If the policy is enabled and the managed user misses the enrollment step and performs first sign in on the device, a pop-up is shown suggesting to either switch to enrollment flow or use another email for sign-in, essentially preventing the managed user from signing in without enrollment.





- Replacing the Bluetooth stack on ChromeOSStarting in ChromeOS 117, and gradually applying to all ChromeOS devices, this Bluetooth software change brings the Android Bluetooth stack, Fluoride, to ChromeOS. The transition happens seamlessly on login, preserving existing paired devices, and should work with Bluetooth devices today with no interruptions. If you experience issues, please file feedback and, if necessary, disable the new stack via chrome://flags/#bluetooth-use-floss.





- Time-lapse recordingThe built-in Camera App now supports Time-Lapse recording. To use the feature, open the Camera App, select Video, then Time-Lapse. Recording can continue for as long as there is available storage space. Camera app determines the right speed for the time-lapse video based on duration recorded, to ensure your video always looks great.








- Enhanced options in clipboard historyEnhancements to Clipboard History menu including introducing new entry points, ways to discover the feature and simplifying feature comprehension making it easier to discover and use. You can now see more detail for items in your clipboard history and can access clipboard history items nested directly in context menus. For users discovering Clipboard History for the first time, we are also introducing educational information to help with understanding this feature.





- ChromeVox dialog changesWe’ve made some changes to the initial out-of-the-box experience (OOBE) dialog that explains what ChromeVox is, who might benefit from activating ChromeVox and requires pressingspaceinstead of offering an on-screen button. With this update, we hope to reduce the number of users who inadvertently activate ChromeVox.





- Up Next Calendar view withJoinvideo callintegrationSee your upcoming events directly from the calendar view and join any digital meetings directly with the newJoinbutton.





- Adaptive ChargingAdaptive Charging is a new ChromeOS power management feature. Devices with Adaptive Charging enabled via Settings charge to 80% and then complete charging to 100% based on an ML model’s prediction for when the user will unplug their device. Reducing the time a device spends at 100% charge helps preserve the battery's health and ability to hold a charge over the lifetime of the device.

- Network Service on Windows will be sandboxedTo improve security and reliability, the network service, already running in its own process, will be sandboxed on Windows. As part of this, third-party code that is currently able to tamper with the network service may be prevented from doing so. This might cause interoperability issues with software that injects code into Chrome's process space, such as Data Loss Prevention software. TheNetworkServiceSandboxEnabledpolicy allows you to disable the sandbox if incompatibilities are discovered. You can test the sandbox in your environment usingtheseinstructions andreportany issues you encounter.Chrome 118 on Windows:Network Service sandboxed on Windows

- Remove ForceMajorVersionToMinorPositionInUserAgent policyChrome plans to remove theForceMajorVersionToMinorPositionInUserAgentpolicy. This policy was introduced in Chrome 99 to control whether the User-Agent string major version would be frozen at 99, in case of User-Agent string parsing bugs when the version changed to 100. Fortunately, we did not need to deploy this feature and only encountered a few minor 3-digit version parsing issues that have all since been fixed. Given that, we intend to remove this policy. If you have any feedback about this policy removal, or are aware of intranet breakage that depends on the policy, please comment onthisbug.Chrome 118 on Android, Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, Windows:Removal ofForceMajorVersionToMinorPositionInUserAgentpolicy

- Support for passkeys in iCloud Keychain on macOSChrome on macOS ≥ 13.5 will gain support for creating and using passkeys from iCloud Keychain. When signing in using WebAuthn, passkeys from iCloud Keychain will be listed as options once the user has granted Chrome the needed permission. If permission has not been granted then a generic "iCloud Keychain" option will appear that will prompt for permission before showing iCloud Keychain passkeys. If permission is denied then iCloud Keychain can still be used, but will have to be manually selected each time. When a site asks to create a platform passkey, Chrome might default to creating the passkey in iCloud Keychain based on whether iCloud Drive is in use and whether WebAuthn credentials from the current profile have been recently used. This can be controlled with a setting on chrome://password-manager/settings, and with the enterprise policy CreatePasskeysInICloudKeychain.Chrome 118 on Mac:The ability to use iCloud Keychain will be enabled in Chrome 118. Whether Chrome defaults to creating platform passkeys in iCloud Keychain may be altered by Finch during the lifetime of 118.

- Hash-prefix real-time lookupsFor standard Safe Browsing protection users, visited URLs now have their safety checked in real time instead of against a less frequently updated local list of unsafe URLs. This is done by sending partial hashes of the URLs to Google Safe Browsing through a proxy via Oblivious HTTP, so that the user’s IP address is not linked to the partial hashes. This change improves security while maintaining privacy for users. If needed, the feature can be disabled through the policy SafeBrowsingProxiedRealTimeChecksAllowed.Chrome 118 on iOS, Chrome OS, LaCrOS, Linux, Mac, Windows:This will start with a 1% rollout and then proceed to 100% of users.

- Red interstitial faceliftIn Chrome 118, users will see minor updates to the red Safe Browsing interstitials. The main body text will include an explicit recommendation from Chrome and site ID will be specified in the details section instead of the main body. The warning icon will be replaced by the danger icon and styling will be updated to be consistent with the latest product standards.

- Form Controls support vertical writing modeCSS property writing-mode should be enabled for form controls elements as it will allow lines of text to be laid out horizontally or vertically and it sets the direction in which blocks progress. With this feature, we are allowing the form control elements select, meter, progress, button, textarea and input to have vertical-rl or vertical-lr writing mode. As needed for Web compatibility, we will slowly rollout the change for a number of form controls in 118 and continue in future milestones.Chrome 118 on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android

- Block all cookies set via JavaScript that contain control charactersUpdates how control characters in cookies set via JavaScript are handled. Specifically, all control characters cause the entire cookie to be rejected (previously a NULL character, a carriage return character, or a line feed character in a cookie line caused it to be truncated instead of rejected entirely, which could have enabled malicious behavior in certain circumstances). This behavior aligns Chrome with the behavior indicated by the latest drafts of RFC6265bis. This change can be disabled using the `--disable-features=BlockTruncatedCookies` or the BlockTruncatedCookies enterprise policy, which will exist for several milestones in case this change causes any breakage.Chrome 118 on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android

- Clearer Safe Browsing protection level settings text and imagesIn Chrome 118, some users will see new text describing the Safe Browsing protection level on both the Security Settings page and the Privacy Guide. The update clarifies the Enhanced Protection level by adding a table and linking to a help center article where users can learn more. The new table helps users understand the trade-offs when selecting that option versus choosing the other options. The descriptions for Standard Protection, No Protection and the password compromise warnings toggle have been simplified to make the options clearer. The Safe Browsing protection level is an existing setting and continues to be controlled by theSafeBrowsingProtectionLevelpolicy value.Chrome 118:Some users will see the updated text and images on the Chrome Security Settings page and on the Privacy Guide.

- IP Protection Phase 0 for ChromeAs early as Chrome 118, Chrome may route traffic for some network requests to Google-owned resources through a privacy proxy. This is an early milestone in a larger effort to protect users' identities by masking their IP address from known cross-site trackers. More information (including enterprise policies) will be provided in the near future.





- Include chrome.tabs API calls in extension telemetry reportsWhen you enable Enhanced Safe Browsing, Chrome will now collect telemetry information about chrome.tabs API calls made by extensions. This information is analyzed on Google servers and further improves the detection of malicious and policy violating extensions. It will also allow better protection for all Chrome extension users. This functionality along with the entire extension telemetry feature can be turned off by settingSafeBrowsingProtectionLevelto any value other than 2 (ie. disable Enhanced Safe Browsing).Chrome 118 on Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, Windows:Feature launches

- Remove Sanitizer APITheSanitizer APIaims to build an easy-to-use, always secure, browser-maintained HTML sanitizer into the platform. It is a cross-browser standardization effort starting in Q2/2020. We shipped an initial version of the Sanitizer API in Chrome 105, based on the then-current specification draft. However, the discussion has meanwhile moved on and the proposed API shape has changed substantially. In order to prevent the current API from becoming entrenched we would like to remove the current implementation.We expect to re-implement the Sanitizer API when the proposed specification stabilizes again.Use counters:The Sanitizer API is currently used on 0.000000492% of page visits.Old vs new API:* Old explainer, API as implemented in "MVP" since Chrome 105:https://github.com/WICG/sanitizer-api/blob/e72b56b361a31b722b4e14491a83e2d25943ba58/explainer.md *New explainer (still in progress):https://github.com/WICG/sanitizer-api/blob/main/explainer.mdChrome 119 on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android

- Deprecate non-standard `shadowroot` attribute for declarative shadow DOMThe standards-track `shadowrootmode` attribute, which enables declarative Shadow DOM, was shipped in Chrome 111 [1]. The older, non-standard `shadowroot` attribute is now deprecated. During the deprecation period, both attributes are functional, however the `shadowroot` attribute does not enable the new streaming behavior, whereas `shadowrootmode` allows streaming of content. There is a straightforward migration path: replace `shadowroot` with `shadowrootmode`. The old `shadowroot` attribute is deprecated as of Chrome Chrome 112, and it will be removed (no longer supported) in Chrome 119, which goes to Stable on November 1, 2023.

- Chrome Third-Party Cookie Deprecation (3PCD)In Chrome 120 and beyond (Jan 2024), Chrome will globally disable third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome traffic as part of ourChrome-facilitated testingin collaboration with the CMA, to allow sites to meaningfully preview what it's like to operate in a world without third-party cookies (3PCs). Most enterprise end users will be excluded from this experiment group automatically. But for the few that may be affected, enterprise admins will be able to utilize an enterprise policy to opt out their managed browsers ahead of the experiment and give enterprises time to make necessary changes to not rely on this policy or third party cookies. We plan to provide more details about this policy and provide more tooling to help identify 3PC use cases.

- Intent to deprecate: Mutation eventsSynchronous Mutation Events, including DOMSubtreeModified, DOMNodeInserted, DOMNodeRemoved, DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument, DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument, and DOMCharacterDataModified, negatively affect page performance, and also significantly increase the complexity of adding new features to the Web. These APIs were deprecated from the spec in 2011, and were replaced (in 2012) by the much better-behaved Mutation Observer API. Usage of the obsolete Mutation Events must be removed or migrated to Mutation Observer.Chrome 127 on Android, Chrome OS, Linux, Mac, Windows:Mutation Events will stop functioning in Chrome 127, around July 30, 2024.

- Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3 back to top Chrome extensions are transitioning to a new manifest version, Manifest V3. This will bring improved privacy for your users—for example, by moving to a model where extensions modify requests declaratively, without the ability to see individual requests. This also improves extension security, as remotely hosted code will be disallowed on Manifest V3. As mentioned earlier in our blog post (https://developer.chrome.com/blog/more-mv2-transition/) the Manifest V2 deprecation timelines are under review and the experiments scheduled for early 2023 are being postponed. During the timeline review, existing Manifest V2 extensions can still be updated, and still run in Chrome. However, all new extensions submitted to the Chrome Web Store must implement Manifest V3. An Enterprise policyExtensionManifestV2Availabilityis available to control whether Manifest v2 extensions are allowed. The policy can be used to test Manifest V3 in your organization ahead of the migration. You can see which Manifest version is being used by all Chrome extensions running on your fleet using the Apps & extensions usage page in Chrome Browser Cloud Management.

The enterprise release notes are available in 9 languages. You can read about Chrome's updates in English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Korean, Indonesian, and Japanese. Please allow 1 to 2 weeks for translation for some languages.



#### Upcoming Admin console changes

## Chrome browser updates





- Enterprises can sign up for security fix notificationsUsingthis sign-up form, you can opt in to receive email notifications whenever there's a Chrome release that contains high or critical security fixes, including zero-day fixes. Chrome uses a fast release cycle to keep you ahead of bad actors, and so you can expect such a release approximately every week. By default, Chrome applies updates automatically when they're made available, so no action is required from admins who keep Chrome's default update behavior. You can read more about Chrome updates strategies for enterpriseshere.





- Chrome increases release velocity with security improvements planned for each weekIn Chrome 115 and previous releases, Chrome maintained a four-week release cycle with a minor release halfway between each major release containing security improvements and minor bug fixes. Major releases continue to be planned for approximately every four weeks, but starting in Chrome 116, minor releases are now planned every week. This allows us to deliver security improvements even faster. If you have auto-updates turned on (the default behavior of Chrome, and our recommendation), then no action is required. Chrome might still release some unplanned updates in response to critical fixes, zero-day fixes, or other unforeseen circumstances. If you want to be notified of the security fixes contained in each release of Chrome, you can sign up for notificationshere. Read more about Chrome Security and why we're making this change in ourblog post.





- Share Sheet migrationChrome is migrating Share functionality from its custom share sheet to the Android system share sheet for Android U+ users. In this migration, we’ve deprecated some functionality such as stylized cards for shared highlights and a redundant button for short (non full-page) screenshots. On Pre-U Android, Chrome still shows the custom share sheet and users can navigate to the system share sheet using theMore (...)button.


Chrome is migrating Share functionality from its custom share sheet to the Android system share sheet for Android U+ users. In this migration, we’ve deprecated some functionality such as stylized cards for shared highlights and a redundant button for short (non full-page) screenshots. On Pre-U Android, Chrome still shows the custom share sheet and users can navigate to the system share sheet using theMore (...)button.





- Google Search side panelChrome is introducing the Search side panel, a new contextual side panel experience that allows users to delve into the content of the page they're currently viewing. The new side panel gives users new tools to get more context about the page they're viewing. We launched the Search side panel to some users in Chrome 115 and subsequently plan to roll out to all users in Chrome 116. You can control access to the Search side panel using theGoogleSearchSidePanelEnabledpolicy.





- X25519Kyber768 key encapsulation for TLSAs early as Chrome 116, Chrome introduces a post-quantum secure TLS key encapsulation mechanism X25519Kyber768, based on aNIST standard. This is exposed as a new TLS cipher suite. TLS automatically negotiates supported ciphers, so this change should be transparent to server operators. However, some TLS middleboxes might be unprepared for the size of a Kyber key encapsulation, or a new TLS ClientHello cipher code point, leading to dropped or hanging connections. This can be resolved by updating your middlebox, or disabling the key encapsulation mechanism via the temporaryPostQuantumKeyAgreementEnabledenterprise policy. However, long term, post-quantum secure ciphers will be required in TLS and the enterprise policy will be removed. This cipher will be used for both TLS and QUIC connections.

- Improving performance: Memory Saver and Energy Saver modesIn Chrome 108, we introduced features designed to improve the performance of Chrome and extend battery life under the following enterprise policies:TabDiscardingExceptions,BatterySaverModeAvailabilityandHighEfficiencyModeEnabled. In Chrome 116, we expand the capabilities of the Memory Saver feature to help users further understand and use tab discarding to their benefit.Users with Memory Saver enabled (policyHighEfficiencyModeEnabled) now have increased visibility of discarded tabs in the tab strip and more insight into memory usage of active and inactive tabs.Additionally, this release makes the management of exceptions (policyTabDiscardingExceptions) more intuitive for users who have access to manage their own exceptions:1. In settings, users can add exceptions based on currently open tabs (in addition to manual entry which exists today)2. In the page action chip of a discarded tab, users can opt the site out from future discarding.


Users with Memory Saver enabled (policyHighEfficiencyModeEnabled) now have increased visibility of discarded tabs in the tab strip and more insight into memory usage of active and inactive tabs.


Additionally, this release makes the management of exceptions (policyTabDiscardingExceptions) more intuitive for users who have access to manage their own exceptions:


1. In settings, users can add exceptions based on currently open tabs (in addition to manual entry which exists today)





- Anti-phishing telemetry expansionIn this feature, we log user-interaction data to Chrome servers and to Safe Browsing servers, which will fill knowledge gaps about how users interact with Safe Browsing phishing warnings and phishing pages. This additional telemetry will help inform where we should concentrate our efforts to improve phishing protection because it will allow us to understand the user better. Admins can opt out by using the Enterprise policiesMetricsReportingEnabledandSafeBrowsingProtectionLevel.





- Enabling BFCache for pages that set Cache-Control: no-storeDocuments with a Cache-Control: no-store header (CCNS) are blocked from enteringBFCache. Chrome 116 will start BFCaching these documents, except for the ones with sensitive information (Github).TheAllowBackForwardCacheForCacheControlNoStorePageEnabledpolicy controls if a page withCache-Control: no-storeheader can be stored in back/forward cache. The website setting this header might not expect the page to be restored from back/forward cache since some sensitive information could still be displayed after the restoration even if it is no longer accessible.If the policy is enabled or unset, the page withCache-Control: no-storeheader might be restored from back/forward cache unless the cache eviction is triggered, for example, when there is HTTP-only cookie change to the site.If the policy is disabled, the page withCache-Control: no-storeheader will not be stored in back/forward cache.

- Idle Timeout policies on DesktopIn Chrome 116, admins can now enforce taking an action, for example, closing the browser, clearing cookies or moving to the profile picker, after Chrome has been idle for some amount of time. You can use theIdleTimeoutpolicy to set a timeout period and theIdleTimeoutActionspolicy to specify actions on timeout.





- OS-native Passkey changes on Windows 11An update to Windows 11 later in 2023 adds support for cross-device passkeys flows in Windowswebauthn.dll v6. Chrome 116 recognizes this version of Windows and stops offering its own cross-device support in Chrome UI, deferring to Windows instead. This results in users seeing a different UI, as shown below. This can be tested with Chrome 116 running on Windows Insider Dev Build 23486 or later.

## ChromeOS updates





- Data processor mode on ChromeOS (including Chrome browser running on managed ChromeOS)In ChromeOS 116, ChromeOS is releasing adata processor modefor a suite of ChromeOS features and services calledEssential Services, switching Google’s role from that of a data controller over personal data, to primarily that of a data processor. Features and services for which Google remains solely a data controller are called “Optional Services”. IT admins who manage ChromeOS devices used by managed Dutch Education accounts will see these new terms and features available to select from August 18, 2023.These are the new tools available in data processor mode for ChromeOS:Data processor mode landing page in the Admin consoleThe ability to turn-on/off individual Optional ServicesTools to assist customers with Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs)A tool to assist customers with data subject deletion requests

- Removal of permissive Chrome Apps webview behaviorsAs early as Chrome 116, Chrome Appswebviewusage have the following restrictions:Using the webviewNewWindowevent to attach to a webview element in another App window causes the window reference returned by thewindow.opencall in the originating webview to be invalidated.A temporary enterprise policyChromeAppsWebViewPermissiveBehaviorAllowedis available to give enterprises time to address possible breakage related to these changes. To test whether this change is the cause of any breakage, without needing to set the enterprise policy, you can restore the previous behavior from Chrome 112 and earlier by navigating tochrome://flagsand disablingchrome://flags/#enable-webview-tag-mparch-behavior.This change was originally scheduled for Chrome 113, but was postponed. Previous release notes mentioned a change to the handling of SSL errors within webviews, but this is no longer part of this change.
- Using the webviewNewWindowevent to attach to a webview element in another App window causes the window reference returned by thewindow.opencall in the originating webview to be invalidated.

- ChromeOS OCR in PDFs for screen reader usersThrough Optical Character Recognition (OCR), users can convert images to text, so that they can access and read them.





- ChromeVox settings move to ChromeOS settingIn Chrome 116, you now access the existing settings for ChromeVox under the ChromeOSAccessibilitysettings pages.





- Customizing input peripherals per device settingsUsers can now manage settings for their input peripherals, such as their mouse and keyboard, at the device level and apply different values for different devices. This provides more control over the peripheral experience on ChromeOS.





- Managing Android App permissionsIn Chrome 116, users have a better view of what data Android apps can access by reviewing allowed app permissions on the Apps page in ChromeOSSettings. Now, users can see a detailed view of the data an Android app can access on the Apps page inSettings, and they can easily manage those permissions.

- ChromeOS Kerberos integration enhancementsStarting with M116, we streamline the end user configuration flows for ChromeOS Kerberos customers. Many users use Kerberos on ChromeOS  to access corporate resources. The new UI enhancements guide users through the configuration of their Kerberos accounts in a guided flow, similar toPassword Manager. For details, see thishelp centerarticle.





- Commercial launch of screensaverWith M116, ChromeOS represents your organization even better. The commercial launch of screensaver for the login screen or MGS lock screen allows admins to customize the appearance of idle devices. Newly added admin settings include the abilities to turn on/off the screensaver, to provide a list of screensaver images, and to customize idle times.





- Enhanced autocorrect featuresWe've enhanced Autocorrect in ChromeOS! Autocorrect is now enabled by default for English in compatible apps, automatically fixing typos, spelling, and other errors. In addition to the new Autocorrect for physical keyboards, this update also enhances the performance of the virtual keyboard's Autocorrect and other Assistive features.





- Additional input method support for Linux appsLinux on ChromeOSnow supports complex input methods, such as Japanese and Korean. This means that you can now use the same input methods that you're already using in Chrome to type in your Linux applications. Not all applications are supported yet, but support for additional applications is coming soon.





- URL-keyed anonymized data collection in Kiosk modeThe policy for URL-keyed anonymized data collection is now supported in Kiosk mode. This policy will be added to the Admin console in a future release.

Note:The items listed below are experimental or planned updates. They might change, be delayed, or canceled before launching to the Stable channel.






## Coming soon

#### Upcoming browser changes





- Extensions Review panelA new review panel will be added in chrome://extensions, which will appear whenever there are potentially unsafe extensions that need the user's attention. The initial launch will highlight extensions that are malware, policy violating or are no longer available in the Chrome Web Store. The user can choose to remove or keep these extensions.There will also be a count of risky extensions needing review that is presented in the ChromePrivacy & Securitysettings page.TheExtensionsUnpublishedAvailabilitypolicy will disable extensions that have been unpublished by the developer or violate Chrome Web Store policy. Note that these extensions might also appear in the Extensions Module's review panel but only if they are not installed by policy. The user can choose to remove or keep them.





- Native Client Support updatesAs early as Chrome 117, we will remove Native Client NaCl support from extensions on Windows, macOS, Linux. An enterprise policy will be available,NativeClientForceAllowed, which will allow Native Client to continue to be used until Chrome 119.





- Updates to Clear Browsing Data on AndroidWe’re making it easier to find and use the browsing data deletion tools that Chrome offers.We’re adding more entry points to Clear Browsing Data, including on the main Chrome menu. We’re also introducing a new quick deletion affordance to enable users to quickly delete their recent history. We’ll maintain and further enhance the more granular ‘Advanced’ Clear Browsing Data page on Privacy Settings.





- Skip unload eventsThe presence of unload event listeners is a primary blocker forback/forward cacheon Chromium based browsers and for Firefox on desktop platforms. On the other hand, for mobile platforms, almost all browsers prioritize thebfcacheby not firing unload events in most cases. To improve the situation, we’ve been working with lots of partners and successfully reduced the use of unload event listeners over the last few years.As early as Chrome 117, to further accelerate this migration, weproposeto have Chrome for desktop gradually skip unload events. In case you need more time to migrate away from unload events, we’ll offer temporary opt-outs in the form of an API and a group policy which will allow you to selectively keep the behavior unchanged.





- Require X.509 key usage extension for RSA certificates chaining to local rootsX.509 certificates used for HTTPS should contain a key usage extension that declares how the key in a certificate may be used. Such instructions ensure certificates are not used in an unintended context, which protects against a class of cross-protocol attacks on HTTPS and other protocols. For this to work, HTTPS clients must check that server certificates match the connection's TLS parameters, specifically that the key usage flag for “digitalSignature” and possibly “keyEncipherment” (depending on TLS ciphers in use) are asserted when using RSA.Chrome 117 will begin enforcing that the key usage extension is set properly on RSA certificates chaining to local roots. Key usage is already required for ECDSA certificates, and for publicly trusted certificates. Enterprises can test and temporarily disable key usage enforcement using the RSAKeyUsageForLocalAnchorsEnabled policy (available in Chrome 116).





- Network service will be sandboxed on Linux and ChromeOSAs early as Chrome 117, the network service will be sandboxed on Linux and ChromeOS to improve security. On Linux, it's possible that third party software (likely data loss prevention or antivirus software) is injecting code into Chrome's processes and will be blocked by this change. This may result in Chrome crashing for your users.If this happens, you should work with the vendor of the third party software to stop it from  injecting code into Chrome's processes. In the meantime, you will be able to use theNetworkServiceSandboxEnabledpolicy to defer the sandboxing. This is a temporary measure intended to help enterprises surprised by the change; the policy will be removed in a future version of Chrome.





- Bounce Tracking mitigationsAs early as Chrome 116, Chrome will launchbounce tracking mitigations. Bounce tracking mitigations will only take effect when the policy is set to true (Block 3rd party cookies). You can use theBlockThirdPartyCookiespolicy to control this feature. Alternatively, if 3rd party cookies are blocked by default you can exempt specific sites by using theCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicy.





- Restricting the use of --load-extensionThe--load-extensioncommand-line switch provides a very low bar for cookie theft malware to load malicious extensions without an installation prompt. Chrome will gradually phase out this switch to reduce this attack vector for malware. Starting in Chrome 116,--load-extensionwill be ignored for users that have enabled Enhanced Safe Browsing.





- Service Worker static routing APIChrome 116 will release the Service Worker static routing API; it enables developers to optimize how Service Workers are loaded. Specifically, it allows developers to configure the routing, and allows them to offload simple things ServiceWorkers do. If the condition matches, the navigation happens without starting ServiceWorkers or executing JavaScript, which allows web pages to avoid performance penalties due to ServiceWorker interceptions.





- Enable access to WebUSB API from extension service workersAs early as Chrome 117, we will enable access to WebUSB API from extension service workers as a migration path for Manifest V2 extensions that currently access the API from a background page.WebUSB policies can also be applied to extension origins to control this behavior. SeeDefaultWebUsbGuardSetting,WebUsbAskForUrls,WebUsbBlockedForUrls, andWebUsbAllowDevicesForUrlsfor more details.





- Simplified sign-in and sync experienceStarting in Chrome 117, some users may experience a simplified and consolidated version of sign-in and sync in Chrome. Chrome sync will no longer be shown as a separate feature in settings or elsewhere. Instead, users can sign in to Chrome to use and save information like passwords, bookmarks and more in their Google Account, subject to the relevant enterprise policies.As before, the functionality previously part of Chrome sync that saves and accesses Chrome data in the Google Account can be turned off fully (viaSyncDisabled) or partially (viaSyncTypesListDisabled). Sign-in to Chrome can be required or disabled viaBrowserSigninas before.Note that the changes do not affect users’ ability to sign in to Google services on the web (like Gmail) without signing in to Chrome, their ability to stay signed out of Chrome, or their ability to control what information is synced with their Google Account.





- IP Protection Phase 0 for ChromeBeginning in Chrome 118, Chrome may route traffic for some network requests to Google-owned resources through a privacy proxy. This is an early milestone in a larger effort to protect users' identities by masking their IP address from known cross-site trackers. More information (including enterprise policies) will be provided in the near future.





- Web MIDI permission promptStarting in Chrome 118, the Web MIDI API access will be gated behind a permissions prompt. Currently, the use of SysEx messages with the Web MIDI API requires explicit user permission. With the planned implementation, even access to the Web MIDI API without SysEx support will require user permission. Both permissions will be requested in a bundled permissions prompt.Three new policiesDefaultMidiSetting,MidiAllowedForUrlsandMidiBlockedForUrlswill be available to allow administrators to pre-configure user access to the API.





- Network Service on Windows will be sandboxed on WindowsAs early as Chrome 118, to improve security and reliability, the network service, already running in its own process, will be sandboxed on Windows. As part of this, third-party code that is currently able to tamper with the network service may be prevented from doing so. This might cause interoperability issues with software that injects code into Chrome's process space, such as Data Loss Prevention software. TheNetworkServiceSandboxEnabledpolicy allows you to disable the sandbox if incompatibilities are discovered. You can test the sandbox in your environment usingthese instructionsandreportany issues you encounter.





- Removal of the RendererCodeIntegrityEnabled policyAs early as Chrome 117, theRendererCodeIntegrityEnabledpolicy will be removed. We recommend that you verify any potential incompatibilities with third party software by no longer applying the policy in advance of this release. You can report any issues you encounter by submitting a bughere.





- Chrome 117 will no longer support macOS 10.13 and macOS 10.14Chrome 117 will no longer support macOS 10.13 and macOS 10.14, which are already outside of their support window with Apple. Users have to update their operating systems in order to continue running Chrome browser. Running on a supported operating system is essential to maintaining security. If run on macOS 10.13 or 10.14, Chrome continues to show an infobar that reminds users that Chrome 117 will no longer support macOS 10.13 and macOS 10.14.





- New Chrome Desktop visual refresh in Chrome 117With Google’s design platform moving toGoogle Material 3, we have an opportunity to modernize our desktop browser across OS’s, leveraging updated UI elements or styling, enhancing personalization through a new dynamic color system, and improving accessibility. The first wave of UI updates will roll out in Chrome 117.The three dot Chrome menu will also be refreshed, providing a foundation to scale personalization and customization experiences in Chrome by enabling customers proximate access to tools and actions. The menu will be updated in phases starting in Chrome 117.





- Update to the lock iconWe plan to replace the lock icon with a variant of the tune icon, which is commonly used to indicate controls and settings. Replacing the lock icon with a neutral indicator prevents the misunderstanding that the lock icon is associated with the trustworthiness of a page, and emphasizes that security should be the default state in Chrome. Our research has also shown that many users never understood that clicking the lock icon showed important information and controls. We think the new icon helps make permission controls and additional security information more accessible, while avoiding the misunderstandings that plague the lock icon.The new icon is scheduled to launch in Chrome 117 as part of a general design refresh for desktop platforms. Chrome will continue to alert users when their connection is not secure. You can see the new tune icon now in Chrome Canary for Desktop if you enable Chrome Refresh 2023 atchrome://flags#chrome-refresh-2023, but keep in mind this flag enables work that is still actively in-progress and under development, and does not represent a final product.We will also replace the icon on Android. On iOS, the lock icon is not tappable, so we will be removing the icon.You can read more inthisblog post.





- Storage Access API with PromptsThe Storage Access API provides a means for authenticated cross-site embeds to check their blocking status and request access to storage if they are blocked. Targeting Chrome 117 for Desktop, we will support the Storage Access API by implementing all the behaviors listed in the specification, i.e. with user prompts, and additionally having its own user-agent-specific behaviors.





- Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3Chrome extensions are transitioning to a new manifest version, Manifest V3. This will bring improved privacy for your users—for example, by moving to a model where extensions modify requests declaratively, without the ability to see individual requests. This also improves extension security, as remotely hosted code will be disallowed on Manifest V3.As mentioned earlier in our blog post,More details on the transition to Manifest V3, the Manifest V2 deprecation timelines are under review and the experiments scheduled for early 2023 are being postponed.During the timeline review, existing Manifest V2 extensions can still be updated, and still run in Chrome. However, all new extensions submitted to the Chrome Web Store must implement Manifest V3.Starting with Chrome 110, an Enterprise policyExtensionManifestV2Availabilityhas been available to control whether Manifest v2 extensions are allowed. The policy can be used to test Manifest V3 in your organization ahead of the migration. After the migration the policy will allow you to extend the usage of Manifest V2 extensions until at least January 2024.You can see which Manifest version is being used by all Chrome extensions running on your fleet using the Apps & extensions usage page inChrome Browser Cloud Management.For more details, refer to theManifest V2 support timeline.





- Removal ForceMajorVersionToMinorPositionInUserAgent policyChrome 118 plans to remove theForceMajorVersionToMinorPositionInUserAgentpolicy. This policy was introduced in Chrome 99 to control whether the User-Agent string major version would be frozen at 99, in case of User-Agent string parsing bugs when the version changed to 100. Fortunately, we did not need to deploy this feature and only encountered a few minor 3-digit version parsing issues that have all since been fixed. Given that, we intend to remove this policy.If you have any feedback about this policy removal, or are aware of intranet breakage that depends on the policy, please comment onthisbug.





- Chrome release schedule changesChrome 119 and all subsequent releases will be shifted forward by one week. For example, Chrome 119 will have its early stable release on October 25 instead of Nov 1. Beta releases will also be shifted forward by one week starting in Chrome 119.





- Chrome 119 to phase out support for Web SQLStarting in Chrome 119, to improve user data security, Chrome will remove support for Web SQL. The Web SQL Database standard was first proposed in April 2009 and abandoned in November 2010. As of today, Chrome is the only major browser with support for Web SQL. The W3C encouraged those needing web databases to adopt Indexed Database or SQLite WASM.The timeline for the deprecation will be:Chrome 115 - Deprecation message addedChrome 117 - 123 - Deprecation trialChrome 119 - Ship removalMore details about the deprecation and removal can be found on theChromestatuspage.An enterprise policyWebSQLAccessis available until Chrome 123 to enable Web SQL to be available.
- Chrome 115 - Deprecation message added
- Chrome 117 - 123 - Deprecation trial
- Chrome 119 - Ship removal


The timeline for the deprecation will be:


- Chrome 115 - Deprecation message added
- Chrome 117 - 123 - Deprecation trial
- Chrome 119 - Ship removal





- Migrate away from data URLs in SVG <use> elementThe SVG spec was recently updated to remove support for data: URLs in SVG <use> element. This improves security of the Web platform as well as compatibility between browsers as Webkit does not support data: URLs in SVG <use> element. We expect to remove support for data: URLs in SVG <use> element in Chrome 119, scheduled to ship in November 2023. You can read more in thisblog post. For enterprises that need additional time to migrate, theDataUrlInSvgUseEnabledpolicy will be available temporarily to re-enable Data URL support for SVG <use> element.





- Chrome profile separationAs early as Chrome 119, three new policies will be created to help enterprises configure enterprise profiles:ProfileSeparationSettings,ProfileSeparationDataMigrationSettings,ProfileSeparationSecondaryDomainAllowlist.





- Removal LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabledForDomainList policyIn Chrome 79, we introduced theLegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabledForDomainListpolicy to revert the SameSite behavior of cookies (possibly on specific domains) to legacy behavior. TheLegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabledForDomainListpolicy’s lifetime has been extended and will now be removed in Chrome 127.





- Intent to deprecate: Mutation EventsSynchronous Mutation Events, including `DOMSubtreeModified`, `DOMNodeInserted`, `DOMNodeRemoved`, `DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument`, `DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument`, and `DOMCharacterDataModified`, negatively affect page performance, and also significantly increase the complexity of adding new features to the Web. These APIs were deprecated from thespecin 2011, and were replaced (in 2012) by the much better-behaved Mutation Observer API. Usage of the obsolete Mutation Events must be removed or migrated to Mutation Observer. Mutation Events will stop functioning in Chrome 127, around July 30, 2024.





- Warnings on insecure downloadsChrome will begin showing warnings on some downloads if those files were downloaded over an insecure connection, that is, not HTTPS. These warnings do not prevent downloading and can be bypassed by the user. Enterprises can test their downloads by enabling warnings viachrome://flags/#insecure-download-warnings. Enterprises can also disable warnings for sites that can not deliver files securely by adding the download site toInsecureContentAllowedForUrls.

#### Upcoming ChromeOS changes





- ChromeOS battery state soundsAs early as Chrome 117, we will add audible sounds to indicate battery status. Users will be able to turn on and off these sounds and Admins will be able to control them through policies.When the device is not plugged in, you will hear warning sounds if:Battery level goes down to 15 minutes of charge time left, and another one when there is 5 minutes left.When the device is plugged in, you will hear an information beep when:Battery level - 0-15% (low)Battery level - 16-79% (med)Battery level - 80-100% (high)In the case where the device is connected to a low power charger, you’ll hear warnings when the battery goes down to 10%, then again at 5%.
- Battery level goes down to 15 minutes of charge time left, and another one when there is 5 minutes left.
- Battery level - 0-15% (low)
- Battery level - 16-79% (med)
- Battery level - 80-100% (high)

#### Upcoming ChromeOS changes

## Chrome browser updates





- Google Search side panelIn Chrome 115, Google introduces the Search side panel, a new contextual side panel experience that allows users to delve into the content of the page they're currently viewing. The new side panel features a search box that allows text-based and visual queries, questions related to the page, and links to more details about the current site. We launch the Search side panel to some users in Chrome 115 and subsequently plan to roll out to all users in Chrome 116. You can control access to the Search side panel using theGoogleSearchSidePanelEnabledpolicy.





- Secure DNS auto-upgrade for some Quad9Secure DNS usersStarting in Chrome 115, for a small subset of Chrome users, secure DNS queries are used instead of insecure DNS queries to perform host name resolution using Quad9 Secure (9.9.9.9) DNS servers. This change affects behavior for a given client under the following conditions only:The client is running on a system that has been configured to use the Quad9 Secure (9.9.9.9) DNS servers.TheDnsOverHttpsModeenterprise policy is set to “Automatic” (the default value is “Off”).TheChromeVariationspolicy is set to enable all variations.The client is randomly selected to be part of the 1% of clients where this behavior is enabled.

- The client is randomly selected to be part of the 1% of clients where this behavior is enabled.





- HTTP requests upgraded to HTTPSAs early as Chrome 115, some users might see HTTP requests automatically upgraded to HTTPs. Any page that can't load via HTTPS is automatically reverted back to HTTP. For standard server configurations, this shouldn't have any visible effect, but it improves your users' security.Some server configurations might cause issues, for example, if different content is served via HTTP and HTTPS. Users can bypass the automatic upgrading by explicitly navigating to anhttp://URL in the Omnibox, or by changing theInsecure Contentsite setting to enabled, accessible via Page Info andchrome://settings/content. You can control this behavior with theHttpsUpgradesEnabledpolicy, and allowlist specific sites with theHttpAllowlistpolicy.In the long term, you should ensure that your organization's servers support HTTPS and serve the same content on both HTTP and HTTPS. If you don't intend to support HTTPS (for example, on an intranet behind a firewall), servers shouldn't respond to port 443, and firewalls should close the connection rather than leave it hanging. You can test HTTPS upgrading in your environment by enablingchrome://flags#https-upgrades. If you come across any issues, you canreportthem to us.Starting in Chrome 115, Chrome automatically enables HTTPS-First Mode based on the user's browsing history. It automatically enables the HTTPS-First Mode interstitial on sites that regularly load over HTTPS. Sites that regularly use plaintext HTTP are unaffected. In practice, this change protects users from downgrade attacks, but is invisible to users.

- Support for Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)Chrome 115 starts rolling out support for ECH on sites that opt in, as a continuation of our network-related efforts to improve our users’ privacy and safety on the web, for example, Secure DNS. This change was originally planned for Chrome 107, but had to be postponed.If your organization’s infrastructure relies on the ability to inspect SNI, for example, filtering, logging, and so on, you should test it. You can enable the new behavior by navigating to chrome://flags and enabling the #encrypted-client-hello flag.On Windows and Linux, you also need to enable Secure DNS for the flag to have an effect.If you notice any incompatibilities, you can use theEncryptedClientHelloEnabledenterprise policy to disable support for ECH.

- Bookmarks and reading list improvements on iOSOn Chrome 115 on iOS, some users who sign in to Chrome from bookmark manager or reading list surfaces can now use and save bookmarks and reading list items in their Google Account. Relevant enterprise policies, such asBrowserSignin,SyncDisabled,SyncTypesListDisabled,EditBookmarksEnabledandManagedBookmarkscontinue to work as before, to configure whether users can use and save items in their Google Account.





- Update for secure DNS queries on Cox ISP serversFor clients running on systems that use the Cox ISP DNS servers, if theDnsOverHttpsModepolicy is set toAutomatic, Chrome uses secure DNS queries instead of insecure DNS queries, starting in Chrome 115 (and in earlier versions, starting on May 16, 2023, if theChromeVariationspolicy is set to enable all variations).

- Reading modeAs more content is read online, Chrome 115 adds a new feature to help improve the online reading experience. Introducing reading mode, a new feature on Chrome browser, which enhances the reading experience on the web for everyone. Reading mode reduces distracting elements through a resizable and customizable reader view in the Chrome browser side panel, enabling readers to focus on the primary content. Users can also customize the font, text size, spacing, theme or background color, and more, making for a more cohesive, intuitive, and comfortable reading experience.

- Removal of SHA1 in server signatures in TLSChrome 115 removes support for signature algorithms using SHA-1 for server signatures during the TLS handshake. SHA1, which has known collisions, has been deprecated by the IETF, and should be avoided, where possible.This does not affect SHA-1 support in server certificates, which was already removed. SHA-1 in client certificates continues to be supported. Enterprises that rely on SHA1 signature schemes in TLS can use theInsecureHashesInTLSHandshakesEnabledpolicy to continue to accept SHA1 in server signatures.


Chrome 115 removes support for signature algorithms using SHA-1 for server signatures during the TLS handshake. SHA1, which has known collisions, has been deprecated by the IETF, and should be avoided, where possible.





- Policy Sync dependency handlingCurrently, we require admins to setSyncDisabledfor any data-deletion policy (BrowsingDataLifetime,ClearBrowsingDataOnExitList). In Chrome 115, we automatically disable sync for the respective data types and no longer require admins to additionally set theSyncDisabledpolicy. We will gradually roll out this feature behind a flag. You can enable this behavior atchrome://flags#data-retention-policies-disable-sync-types-needed.





- Skia renderer for PDF renderingChrome 115 adds a new enterprise policy,PdfUseSkiaRendererEnabled, to override user choice on whether to enable Skia renderer. When Skia renderer is enabled, it switches the PDF render device from AGG (Anti-Grain Geometry) to Skia. Skia renderer provides enhanced technical support and uses different algorithms for drawing graphics. Any resulting visual differences are expected to be very minor.





- One Time Permissions desktopWhen users are prompted for a permission they can currently select Allow or Deny, both options are stored permanently. This feature adds anAllow this timeoption for geolocation, camera and microphone permissions. This fine-tunes the permission granted to a newly introduced session, which we believe more accurately represents a one-time permission session, without affecting any common scenarios. In Chrome 115, we start slowly rolling out this feature to a subset of users.





- Privacy Sandbox Developer enrollment formTo access the Privacy Sandbox relevance and measurement APIs on Chrome and Android, developers need toenrollwith the Privacy Sandbox. The developer enrollment process verifies companies before they can use the APIs, as an additional layer of protection for user privacy. As part of this enrollment process, we require developers to agree to restrictions around the usage of these services to prevent re-identification of users across sites.





- Update on BrowsingDataLifetime policyWe have updated the documentation forBrowsingDataLifetimeto state thatdownload_historyandhosted_app_dataare not supported on Android.

- Set Up Chromemodule for iOSOn iOS, some new users in Chrome 115 see the newSet Up Chromemodule. This module provides options, in the center of the new tab page, to allow new users to view and complete items that help them set up and get the most out of Chrome, on their own time. The items listed in the module are optional, and the module displays temporarily for up to a few weeks after installing the app. At this time, this is only available for iOS.








- Carousel on the GoogleNew tabpageA new carousel on the GoogleNew tabpage allows users to swipe between certain modules. This is a limited-availability feature for some new users. The carousel can display in two ways:With theMost Visited SitesandShortcutsmodule, orWith theShortcutsmodule.For example, a user might see Most Visited Sites but can swipe to see Shortcuts.
- With theMost Visited SitesandShortcutsmodule, or
- With theShortcutsmodule.

## Chrome browser updates

## ChromeOS updates





- App Streaming on ChromeOSAs early as ChromeOS 115, App Streaming enhances thePhone Hubexperience, by allowing users to see and interact with streamed apps running on their Pixel phone. When a user receives a mirrored conversation notification from their Pixel phone, a simple tap on that notification kicks off an app stream directly to the user's ChromeOS desktop. This is part of aGoogle-wide ambient computingeffort.

- Floating windows on ChromeOSIn Chrome 115, a newWindow layoutmenu in ChromeOS helps to accelerate common actions like split-screening two windows. In addition, we're adding a new window state,Float, which allows users to set a window as always-on-top.





- Pause cast for cast moderatorWhile usingcast moderator, sometimes users need a quick way to pause what they are casting. In ChromeOS 115, withPause cast, you can now pause what you cast to the shared screen on a still image, while you do something else on your computer.In ChromeOS Quick Settings or from Chrome browser Cast menu, selectPauseto display the last casted screen on the cast receiver. While paused, other actions you perform on your computer are NOT cast to the cast receiver. When cast is resumed, your computer starts mirroring to the cast receiver again.





- Enhanced signature options for PDF toolkitIn ChromeOS 115, the Gallery PDF toolkit makes it easier for users to sign their documents, allowing for the creation of a free-hand signature that is saved in the app for subsequent use. Gallery is the ChromeOS media multi-tool that provides users with fast, consistent, and discoverable ways to view, tweak, and route various media types.





- Passpoint: Seamless, secure connection to Wi-Fi networksPasspoint streamlines Wi-Fi access and eliminates the need for users to find and authenticate a network each time they visit.  Once a user accesses the Wi-Fi network offered at a location, the Passpoint-enabled client device will automatically connect upon subsequent visits. Wi-Fi Passpoint is now supported on ChromeOS through supported Android applications. Wi-Fi Passpoint is a set of Wi-Fi mechanisms defined by the Wi-Fi Alliance that facilitate and automate the provisioning and configuration of secure Wi-Fi networks while also minimizing user intervention. Once provisioned, whenever a compatible and secured Wi-Fi network is in range, ChromeOS can automatically connect to it without the need for user interaction.


- Expand Language Packs to Text-to-SpeechSome Google Text-to-Speech voices that were previously preinstalled are now downloaded over the network when they are needed. This frees up some space on the ChromeOS device.

## Coming soon

#### Upcoming browser changes





- X25519Kyber768 key encapsulation for TLSAs early as Chrome 116, Chrome will introduce a post-quantum secure TLS key encapsulation mechanism X25519Kyber768, based on aNIST standard. This will be exposed as a new TLS cipher suite. TLS automatically negotiates supported ciphers, so this change should be transparent to server operators. However, some TLS middleboxes might be unprepared for the size of a Kyber key encapsulation, or a new TLS ClientHello cipher code point, leading to dropped or hanging connections. This can be resolved by updating your middlebox, or disabling the key encapsulation mechanism via the temporary PostQuantumKeyAgreementEnabled enterprise policy. However, long term, post-quantum secure ciphers will be required in TLS and the enterprise policy will be removed.





- Improving performance: Memory Saver and Energy Saver modesIn Chrome 108, we introduced features designed to improve the performance of Chrome and extend battery life under the following enterprise policies:TabDiscardingExceptions,BatterySaverModeAvailabilityandHighEfficiencyModeEnabled. In Chrome 116, we will expand the capabilities of the Memory Saver feature to help users further understand and use tab discarding to their benefit.Users with Memory Saver enabled (policyHighEfficiencyModeEnabled) will have increased visibility of discarded tabs in the tab strip and more insight into memory usage of active and inactive tabs.Additionally, this release will make the management of exceptions (policyTabDiscardingExceptions) more intuitive for users who have access to manage their own exceptions:In settings, users will be able to add exceptions based on currently open tabs (in addition to manual entry which exists today)In the page action chip of a discarded tab, users will have the option to opt the site out from future discarding.
- In settings, users will be able to add exceptions based on currently open tabs (in addition to manual entry which exists today)

In Chrome 116, we will expand the capabilities of the Memory Saver feature to help users further understand and use tab discarding to their benefit.


Users with Memory Saver enabled (policyHighEfficiencyModeEnabled) will have increased visibility of discarded tabs in the tab strip and more insight into memory usage of active and inactive tabs.


Additionally, this release will make the management of exceptions (policyTabDiscardingExceptions) more intuitive for users who have access to manage their own exceptions:


1. In settings, users will be able to add exceptions based on currently open tabs (in addition to manual entry which exists today)
2. In the page action chip of a discarded tab, users will have the option to opt the site out from future discarding.





- Anti-phishing telemetry expansionIn this feature, we log user-interaction data to Chrome servers and to Safe Browsing servers, which will fill knowledge gaps about how users interact with Safe Browsing phishing warnings and phishy pages. This additional telemetry will help inform where we should concentrate our efforts to improve phishing protection because it will allow us to understand the user better. Admins can opt out by using the Enterprise policiesMetricsReportingEnabledandSafeBrowsingProtectionLevel.





- Network Service on Windows will be sandboxedAs early as Chrome 116, to improve security and reliability, the network service, already running in its own process, will be sandboxed on Windows. As part of this, third-party code that is currently able to tamper with the network service may be prevented from doing so. This might cause interoperability issues with software that injects code into Chrome's process space, such as Data Loss Prevention software. TheNetworkServiceSandboxEnabledpolicy allows you to disable the sandbox if incompatibilities are discovered. You can test the sandbox in your environment usingthese instructionsandreportany issues you encounter.





- Enabling BFCache for pages that set Cache-Control: no-storeDocuments with aCache-Control: no-storeheader (CCNS) are blocked from enteringBFCache. Chrome 116 will start BFCaching these documents, except for the ones with sensitive information (Github).TheAllowBackForwardCacheForCacheControlNoStorePageEnabledpolicy controls if a page withCache-Control: no-storeheader can be stored in back/forward cache. The website setting this header might not expect the page to be restored from back/forward cache since some sensitive information could still be displayed after the restoration even if it is no longer accessible.If the policy is enabled or unset, the page withCache-Control: no-storeheader might be restored from back/forward cache unless the cache eviction is triggered, for example, when there is HTTP-only cookie change to the site.If the policy is disabled, the page withCache-Control: no-storeheader will not be stored in back/forward cache.

If the policy is enabled or unset, the page withCache-Control: no-storeheader might be restored from back/forward cache unless the cache eviction is triggered, for example, when there is HTTP-only cookie change to the site.





- Idle Timeout policiesIn Chrome 116, admins will be able to enforce taking an action, for example closing the browser, or moving to the profile picker, after Chrome has been idle for some amount of time. You will be able to  use theIdleTimeoutpolicy to set a timeout period and theIdleTimeoutActionspolicy to specify actions on timeout.





- Windows 11 changes affecting Chrome in ~SeptemberAn update to Windows 11 later in 2023 will add support for cross-device passkeys flows in Windowswebauthn.dll v6. Chrome 116 will recognize this version of Windows and stop offering its own cross-device support in Chrome UI, deferring to Windows instead. This will result in users seeing a different UI, as shown below. This can be tested with Chrome 116 running on Windows Insider Dev Build 23486 or later.Before:After:

- Native Client Support updatesAs early as Chrome 117, we will remove Native Client NaCl support from extensions on Windows, macOS, Linux. An enterprise policy will be available,NativeClientForceAllowed, which will allow Native Client to continue to be used until Chrome 119.





- Skip unload eventsThe presence of unload event listeners is a primary blocker forback/forward cacheon Chromium based browsers and for Firefox on desktop platforms. On the other hand, for mobile platforms, almost all browsers prioritize thebfcacheby not firing unload events in most cases. To improve the situation, we’ve been working with lots of partners and successfully reduced the use of unload event listeners over the last few years.As early as Chrome 117, to further accelerate this migration, weproposeto have Chrome for desktop gradually skip unload events. In case you need more time to migrate away from unload events, we’ll offer temporary opt-outs in the form of an API and a group policy which will allow you to selectively keep the behavior unchanged.

- Extensions Review panelA new review panel will be added in chrome://extensions which will appear whenever there are potentially unsafe extensions that need the user's attention. The initial launch will highlight extensions that are malware, policy violating or are no longer available in the Chrome Web Store. The user can choose to remove or keep these extensions.There will also be a count of risky extensions needing review that is presented in the ChromePrivacy & Securitysettings page.TheExtensionsUnpublishedAvailabilitypolicy will disable extensions that have been unpublished by the developer or violate Chrome Web Store policy. Note that these extensions might also appear in the Extensions Module's review panel but only if they are not installed by policy. The user can choose to remove or keep them.

- Require X.509 key usage extension for RSA certificates chaining to local rootsX.509 certificates used for HTTPS should contain a key usage extension that declares how the key in a certificate may be used. Such instructions ensure certificates are not used in an unintended context, which protects against a class of cross-protocol attacks on HTTPS and other protocols. For this to work, HTTPS clients must check that server certificates match the connection's TLS parameters, specifically that the key usage flag for “digitalSignature” and possibly “keyEncipherment” (depending on TLS ciphers in use) are asserted when using RSA.Chrome 117 will begin enforcing that the key usage extension is set properly on RSA certificates chaining to local roots. Key usage is already required for ECDSA certificates, and for publicly trusted certificates. Enterprises can test and temporarily disable key usage enforcement using theRSAKeyUsageForLocalAnchorsEnabledpolicy (available in Chrome 116).

- Bounce Tracking mitigationsAs early as Chrome 116, Chrome will launchbounce tracking mitigations. Bounce tracking mitigations will only take effect when the policy is set to true (Block 3rd party cookies). You can use theBlockThirdPartyCookiespolicy to control this feature. Alternatively, if 3rd party cookies are blocked by default you can exempt specific sites by using theCookiesAllowedForUrlspolicy.





- Restricting the use of --load-extensionThe--load-extensioncommand-line switch provides a very low bar for cookie theft malware to load malicious extensions without an installation prompt. Chrome will gradually phase out this switch to reduce this attack vector for malware. Starting in Chrome 116, --load-extensionwill be ignored for users that have enabled Enhanced Safe Browsing.

- Service Worker static routing APIChrome 116 will release the Service Worker static routing API; it enables developers to optimize how Service Workers are loaded. Specifically, it allows developers to configure the routing, and allows them to offload simple things ServiceWorkers do. If the condition matches, the navigation happens without starting ServiceWorkers or executing JavaScript, which allows web pages to avoid performance penalties due to ServiceWorker interceptions.

- Enable access toWebUSB API from extension service workersAs early as Chrome 117, we will enable access to WebUSB API from extension service workers as a migration path for Manifest V2 extensions that currently access the API from a background page.WebUSB policies can also be applied to extension origins to control this behavior. SeeDefaultWebUsbGuardSetting,WebUsbAskForUrls,WebUsbBlockedForUrls, andWebUsbAllowDevicesForUrlsfor more details.


As early as Chrome 117, we will enable access to WebUSB API from extension service workers as a migration path for Manifest V2 extensions that currently access the API from a background page.





- Simplified sign-in and sync experienceStarting in Chrome 117, some users may experience a simplified and consolidated version of sign-in and sync in Chrome. Chrome Sync will no longer be shown as a separate feature in settings or elsewhere. Instead, users can sign in to Chrome to use and save information like passwords, bookmarks and more in their Google Account, subject to the relevant enterprise policies.As before, the functionality previously part of Chrome Sync that saves and accesses Chrome data in the Google Account can be turned off fully (viaSyncDisabled) or partially (viaSyncTypesListDisabled). Sign-in to Chrome can be required or disabled viaBrowserSigninas before.Note that the changes do not affect users’ ability to sign in to Google services on the web (like Gmail) without signing in to Chrome, their ability to stay signed out of Chrome, or their ability to control what information is synced with their Google Account.

- Web MIDI permission promptStarting in Chrome 117, the Web MIDI API access will be gated behind a permissions prompt. Currently, the use of SysEx messages with the Web MIDI API requires explicit user permission. With the planned implementation, even access to the Web MIDI API without SysEx support will require user permission. Both permissions will be requested in a bundled permissions prompt.Three new policiesDefaultMidiSetting,MidiAllowedForUrlsandMidiBlockedForUrlswill be available to allow administrators to pre-configure user access to the API.

- Removal of the RendererCodeIntegrityEnabled policyAs early as Chrome 117, theRendererCodeIntegrityEnabledpolicy will be removed. We recommend that you verify any potential incompatibilities with third party software by no longer applying the policy in advance of this release. You can report any issues you encounter by submitting a bughere.





- Chrome 117 will no longer support macOS 10.13 and macOS 10.14Chrome 117 will no longer support macOS 10.13 and macOS 10.14, which are already outside of their support window with Apple. Users have to update their operating systems in order to continue running Chrome browser. Running on a supported operating system is essential to maintaining security. If run on macOS 10.13 or 10.14, Chrome continues to show an infobar that reminds users that Chrome 117 will no longer support macOS 10.13 and macOS 10.14.





- New Chrome Desktop refresh and Chrome menu in Chrome 117With Google’s design platform moving toGoogle Material 3, we have an opportunity to modernize our desktop browser across OS’s, leveraging updated UI elements or styling, enhancing personalization through a new dynamic color system, and improving accessibility. The first wave of UI updates will roll out in Chrome 117.The three dot Chrome menu will also be refreshed, providing a foundation to scale desktop Chrome UI, communications, and personalization. The menu will be updated in phases starting in Chrome 117 with the Desktop Refresh.





- Update for lock iconWe plan to replace the lock icon with a variant of the tune icon, which is commonly used to indicate controls and settings. Replacing the lock icon with a neutral indicator prevents the misunderstanding that the lock icon is associated with the trustworthiness of a page, and emphasizes that security should be the default state in Chrome. Our research has also shown that many users never understood that clicking the lock icon showed important information and controls. We think the new icon helps make permission controls and additional security information more accessible, while avoiding the misunderstandings that plague the lock icon.The new icon is scheduled to launch in Chrome 117 as part of a general design refresh for desktop platforms. Chrome will continue to alert users when their connection is not secure. You can see the new tune icon now in Chrome Canary if you enable Chrome Refresh 2023 at chrome://flags#chrome-refresh-2023, but keep in mind this flag enables work that is still actively in-progress and under development, and does not represent a final product.On iOS, the lock icon is not tappable, so we will be removing the icon.You can read more inthisblog post.

- Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3Chrome extensions are transitioning to a new manifest version, Manifest V3. This will bring improved privacy for your users—for example, by moving to a model where extensions modify requests declaratively, without the ability to see individual requests. This also improves extension security, as remotely hosted code will be disallowed on Manifest V3.As mentioned earlier in our blog post,More details on the transition to Manifest V3, the Manifest V2 deprecation timelines are under review and the experiments scheduled for early 2023 are being postponed.During the timeline review, existing Manifest V2 extensions can still be updated, and still run in Chrome. However, all new extensions submitted to the Chrome Web Store must implement Manifest V3.Starting with Chrome 110, an Enterprise policyExtensionManifestV2Availabilityhas been available to control whether Manifest v2 extensions are allowed. The policy can be used to test Manifest V3 in your organization ahead of the migration. After the migration the policy will allow you to extend the usage of Manifest V2 extensions until at least January 2024.You can see which Manifest version is being used by all Chrome extensions running on your fleet using the Apps & extensions usage page inChrome Browser Cloud Management.For more details, refer to theManifest V2 support timeline.

- Removal ForceMajorVersionToMinorPositionInUserAgent policyChrome 118 plans to remove theForceMajorVersionToMinorPositionInUserAgentpolicy. This policy was introduced in Chrome 99 to control whether the User-Agent string major version would be frozen at 99, in case of User-Agent string parsing bugs when the version changed to 100. Fortunately, we did not need to deploy this feature and only encountered a few minor 3-digit version parsing issues that have all since been fixed. Given that, we intend to remove this policy.If you have any feedback about this policy removal, or are aware of intranet breakage that depends on the policy, please comment onthisbug.

- Chrome 119 to phase out support for Web SQLStarting in Chrome 119, to improve user data security, Chrome will remove support for Web SQL. The Web SQL Database standard was first proposed in April 2009 and abandoned in November 2010. As of today, Chrome is the only major browser with support for Web SQL. The W3C encouraged those needing web databases to adopt Indexed Database or SQLite WASM.The timeline for the deprecation will be:Chrome 115 - Add deprecation messageChrome 118 - 123 - Deprecation trialChrome 119 - Ship removalMore details about the deprecation and removal can be found on theChromestatuspage.An enterprise policyWebSQLAccessis available until Chrome 123 to enable Web SQL to be available.

- Removal LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabledForDomainList policyIn Chrome 79, we introduced theLegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabledForDomainListpolicy to revert the SameSite behavior of cookies (possibly on specific domains) to legacy behavior.LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabledForDomainListpolicy will be removed in Chrome 121.





- Intent to deprecate: Mutation EventsSynchronous Mutation Events, including `DOMSubtreeModified`, `DOMNodeInserted`, `DOMNodeRemoved`, `DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument`, `DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument`, and `DOMCharacterDataModified`, negatively affect page performance, and also significantly increase the complexity of adding new features to the Web. These APIs were deprecated from thespecin 2011, and were replaced (in 2012) by the much better-behaved Mutation Observer API. Usage of the obsolete Mutation Events must be removed or migrated to Mutation Observer. Mutation Events will stop functioning in Chrome 127, around July 30, 2024.

- Removal of permissive Chrome Apps webview behaviorsAs early as Chrome 116, Chrome Appswebviewusage have the following restrictions:SSL errors within webview show an error page that does not provide the user the option to unsafely proceed.The use of the webviewNewWindowevent to attach to a webview element in another App window causes the window reference returned by the window.open call in the originating webview to be invalidated.A temporary enterprise policyChromeAppsWebViewPermissiveBehaviorAllowedwill be available to give enterprises time to address possible breakage related to these changes. To test whether this change is the cause of any breakage, without needing to set the enterprise policy, the previous behavior from Chrome 112 and earlier can also be restored by navigating tochrome://flagsand disablingchrome://flags/#enable-webview-tag-mparch-behavior.This change was originally scheduled for Chrome 113, but was postponed.

- Chrome Root Store updatesAs early as Chrome 114, to improve user security and provide a consistent experience across different platforms, Chrome switches to its own default root store and built-in certificate verifier on:AndroidLinuxChromeOSTheChromeRootStoreEnabledpolicy allows selective disabling of the Chrome Root Store in favor of the platform root store. You can set this policy to Disabled to force the use of the platform root store, otherwise it is enabled by default. The policy will be made available onAndroid, Linux,andChromeOSuntil Chrome 120.The Chrome Root Store is already enabled by default on:WindowsMacOSTheChromeRootStoreEnabledpolicy has been removed fromWindowsandMacin Chrome 113. Support for trusted leaf certificates and the Windows Trusted People store was added for Chrome 111. Support for name constraints on local trust anchors was added back in Chrome 112.Chrome continues to use custom local roots installed to the operating system’s trust store. See our article about theChrome Root Programfor more information. We do not anticipate any changes to how enterprises currently manage their fleet and trusted enterprise CAs, such as through group policy, macOS Keychain Access, or system management tools like Puppet.

- Support for Private State TokensChrome 114 makes the Private State Tokens API available for use by websites. Private State Tokens enable trust in a user's authenticity to be conveyed from one context to another, to help sites combat fraud and distinguish bots from real humans—without the exchange of user identifying information. Availability of Private State Tokens is controlled using a new setting in Chrome settings calledAuto-verify. Read more in thisdeveloper blog post.





- Inactive Tabsin Chrome app on iPhone and iPadIn Chrome 114, old tabs are now grouped under a newInactive Tabssection in theTabgrid view. Chrome users can access the inactive tabs section to view all old tabs or close them using the new bulk tab functionality. Alternatively, users can simply click to bring back an inactive tab.





- Lock profile cookie files on diskTo help protect Chrome users against malware attempting to steal cookie information, Chrome 114 on Windows holds an exclusive lock on the profile cookie files on disk. To ensure this behavior does not interfere with any sanctioned software on your system, you can run Chrome with the-enable-features=LockProfileCookieDatabasecommand-line flag on theDevorBetachannel of Chrome 114.

- Rebranding and updates in Google Password ManagerIn Chrome 114, the password manager is rebranded asGoogle Password Manager.Google Password Manageroffers more functionality and is easier to access using the three dot menu. The upgradedGoogle Password Manager:groups similar passwords togetherhas an improved checkup flowand you can add the password manager shortcut to your desktop.

- ImprovedCheck passwordson iOSTheCheck passwordsfeature of Password Manager on iOS includes a list of passwords flagged by Google as unsafe. On other platforms, these are further categorized as: compromised, weak, or reused. Chrome 114 now introduces these granular categories on iOS.





- Saving and retrieving notes in Password Manager now easierChrome 114 revamps the password management user journey, triggered from the key icon in the omnibox. It replaces the current list of passwords with a new list that allows navigating to the password details view. In the password details view, users can copy the username or password, unmask the password and edit the stored note.





- Password manager policy disables password importWe recently fixed an issue that previously allowed users to import passwords even though the Password Manager was disabled by Enterprise policy. Users can no longer import passwords when thePasswordManagerEnabledpolicy is set to false.





- Updates to Bookmarks on DesktopStarting in Chrome 114, some users see an updated experience of the Bookmarks side panel, including features such as filtering, sorting, and editing.

- Unpacking nested archives for download protectionStarting in Chrome 114, users with Safe Browsing set to Standard or Enhanced protection now begin recursively unpacking downloads of nested archives. This extends the long-standing protections Chrome offers against malware and unwanted software, and specifically combats techniques abused by distributors of cookie theft malware. TheSafeBrowsingProtectionLevelpolicy allows you to enable or disable Safe Browsing, including this feature.





- Separate storage of settings synced to accountFor Chrome users on iOS and Android who have Sync enabled, settings synced to their Google account are now kept separate from the local Chrome settings, which were set when Sync was off. This allows for strictly less data sharing than previously: local settings don’t get automatically uploaded when turning on Sync, and no settings from the account are left behind on the device when Sync is turned off. This feature is still disabled by default and you can enable it using the flagchrome://flags#enable-preferences-account-storage.As an admin, you can control who can save and sync data related tomanaged Google accounts.There are two existing policies to disable Sync functionality, which continue to apply:SyncDisabled: Disables the entire Chrome Sync infrastructure, including settings.SyncTypesListDisabled: Disables specified individual Sync data types. The existing valuepreferencescovers settings.
- SyncDisabled: Disables the entire Chrome Sync infrastructure, including settings.
- SyncTypesListDisabled: Disables specified individual Sync data types. The existing valuepreferencescovers settings.

- Side Panel APIManifest V3 extensions can now add their own side panel to Chrome’s built-in side panel UI. See the SidePanel APIChrome developers articlefor usage and examples.





- Pick up where you left off on AndroidChrome on iOS now lets new users re-open multiple tabs that were recently active and open on their Android device. This means that they can easily resume journeys on their new iOS instance of Chrome.





- Chrome Enterprise profiles signoutA bug has been fixed where managed profiles became unmanaged and triggered the profile separation dialog all over again for a previously managed profile. This fix ensures that managed profiles do not inadvertently get signed out from Chrome.





- Update chip on desktopIn Chrome 114, we are experimenting with new strings in theUpdate chip on desktop.We have refreshed the update strings in the three-dots menu to encourage users to apply updates (and restart) quicker.

## ChromeOS updates





- Cursive pre-installed for Enterprise and Education accountsCursive, a stylus-first notes app, is now available for Chromebook. It will be pre-installed for all Enterprise and Education accounts on stylus-enabled Chromebooks. If you want toblock access to the app, you can prevent Chromebooks in your enterprise from accessingcursive.apps.chrome.





- Passpoint: Seamless, secure connection to Wi-Fi networksStarting as early as ChromeOS 114, Passpoint will streamline Wi-Fi access and eliminate the need for users to find and authenticate a network each time they visit. Once a user accesses the Wi-Fi network offered at a location, the Passpoint-enabled client device will automatically connect upon subsequent visits.





- Mandatory extensions for Incognito navigationIn Chrome OS 114,Extensionsallow admins to enforce security features and customizations in their OU but they cannot be enforced in Incognito mode without user consent. This can be a problem as users can bypass extension-set features, for example, proxies by using Incognito mode for navigation.TheMandatoryExtensionsForIncognitoNavigationpolicy allows you to configure a list of extensions that users need to explicitly allow to run in Incognito, to use Incognito mode for navigation.

- Audio controls visibilitySettings on ChromeOS now have a more native OS settings experience housed in theSettingsapp, available through App Launcher or the cog icon in the Quick Settings menu. In ChromeOS 114, users can now find all sound controls in the ChromeOSSettingsapp.





- ChromeVox earconsChromeVoxis the built-in screen reader on Chromebooks. In ChromeOS 114, an audio indicator (anearcon) now plays when a user with ChromeVox enabled uses the ChromeVox keyboard shortcut to toggle selection on or off.

#### Upcoming browser changes





- HTTP requests upgraded to HTTPS in Chrome 115As early as Chrome 115, some users may see HTTP requests automatically upgraded to HTTPs. Any page that can't load via HTTPS is automatically reverted back to HTTP. For standard server configurations, this shouldn't have any visible effect, but improves your users' security.Some server configurations may cause issues, for example if different content is served via HTTP and HTTPS. Users can disable automatic upgrading for a specific site by changing theInsecure Contentsite setting to enabled, accessible via Page Info orchrome://settings/content. You can control this behavior with theHttpsUpgradesEnabledpolicy, and allowlist specific sites with theHttpAllowlistpolicy.In the long term, you should ensure that your organization's servers support HTTPS and serve the same content on both HTTP and HTTPS. If you don't intend to support HTTPS (e.g. on an internal intranet behind a firewall), servers shouldn't respond to port 443, and firewalls should close the connection rather than leave it hanging. You can test HTTPS upgrading in your environment by enablingchrome://flags#https-upgrades. Pleasereportany issues you encounter.





- Chrome policy: disable extensions unpublished from Chrome Web Store (CWS)As early as Chrome 115, we will release the Enterprise policyExtensionUnpublishedAvailabilityto disable extensions that have been unpublished from the Chrome Web Store.





- Skip unload eventsThe presence of unload event listeners is a primary blocker forback/forward cacheon Chromium based browsers and for Firefox on desktop platforms. On the other hand, for mobile platforms, almost all browsers prioritize thebfcacheby not firing unload events in most cases. To improve the situation, we’ve been working with lots of partners and successfully reduced the use of unload event listeners over the last few years. To further accelerate this migration, weproposeto have Chrome for desktop gradually skip unload events, as early as Chrome 115. In case you need more time to migrate away from unload events, we’ll offer temporary opt-outs in the form of an API and a group policy which will allow you to selectively keep the behavior unchanged.





- master_preferences to initial_preferences migrationAs part of Chrome's ongoing transition to use more inclusive naming, the example in the Enterprise bundle has been renamed frommaster_preferencestoinitial_prefereces. While there are no changes in Chrome's interpretation of the file, the following fields are no longer present in theinitial_preferencesexample file:Removed from example because they're no longer valid:sync_promo.show_on_first_run_allowedsuppress_first_run_bubblesuppress_first_run_Default_browser_promptRemoved from example because they can be controlled by a recommended policy:homepagehomepage_is_newtabpageshow_home_buttonsessionbookmark_barimport_* except for import_bookmarks_from_filemake_chrome_default_*Removed from example because they're not applicable to enterprise usage, or only applicable to for user-level install:ping_delaydo_not_launch_chromedo_no_register_for_update_launch

- Release cycle changesChrome 115 stable release will be moved from June 27 to July 18. All dates after this have been adjusted to account for this delay. Please see theChromium Dash Schedulefor updated dates.





- Bookmarks and Reading List improvements on iOSOn Chrome 115 on iOS, some users who sign in to Chrome from bookmark manager or reading list surfaces will be able to use and save bookmarks and reading list items in their Google Account. Relevant enterprise policies such asBrowserSignin,SyncDisabled,SyncTypesListDisabled,EditBookmarksEnabledandManagedBookmarkswill continue to work as before and can be used to configure whether users use and save items in their Google Account.





- Update for Secure DNS / Cox ISP usersFor clients running on systems that use the Cox ISP DNS servers, if theDnsOverHttpsModepolicy is set to Automatic, then secure DNS queries will be used by Chrome instead of insecure DNS queries starting in Chrome 115 (and in earlier versions, starting on May 16, 2023, if theChromeVariationspolicy is set to enable all variations).





- Reading modeAs more content is read online, we’re adding a new feature to help improve the online reading experience. Introducing reading mode, a new feature on Chrome browser, enhances the reading experience on the web for everyone. Reading mode reduces distracting elements through a resizable and customizable reader view in the Chrome browser side panel, enabling readers to focus on the primary content. Users can also customize the font, text size, spacing, theme/background color, and more, making for a more cohesive, intuitive, and comfortable reading experience.





- Anti-phishing telemetry expansionIn this feature, we log user-interaction data to Chrome servers and to Safe Browsing servers that will fill knowledge gaps about how users interact with Safe Browsing phishing warnings and phishy pages. This additional telemetry will help inform where we should concentrate our efforts to improve phishing protection because it will allow us to understand the user better. Admins can opt out by using the Enterprise policiesMetricsReportingEnabledandSafeBrowsingProtectionLevel.





- Deprecating the use of SHA1 in server signatures in TLSChrome 115 is removing support for signature algorithms using SHA-1 for server signatures during the TLS handshake. This does not affect SHA-1 support in server certificates, which was already removed, or in client certificates, which continues to be supported. SHA1 has known collisions, has been deprecated by the IETF, and should be avoided.Enterprises that rely on SHA1 signature schemes in TLS can use theInsecureHashesInTLSHandshakesEnabledpolicy to continue to accept SHA1 in server signatures.





- Policy Sync dependency handlingCurrently, we require admins to setSyncDisabledfor any data-deletion policy (BrowsingDataLifetime,ClearBrowsingDataOnExitList). Starting in Chrome 115, we will automatically disable sync for the respective data types and will no longer require admins to set the dependent policy.


↑ back to top





- Web MIDI permission promptStarting in Chrome 116, the Web MIDI API access will be gated behind a permissions prompt. Currently, the use of SysEx messages with the Web MIDI API requires an explicit user permission. With the planned implementation, even access to the Web MIDI API without SysEx support will require user permission. Both permissions will be requested in a bundled permissions prompt.Three new policiesDefaultMidiSetting,MidiAllowedForUrlsandMidiBlockedForUrlswill be available to allow administrators to pre-configure users’ access to the API.





- X25519Kyber768 key encapsulation for TLSAs early as Chrome 116, Chrome is introducing a post-quantum secure TLS key encapsulation mechanism X25519Kyber768, based on aNIST standard. This is exposed as a new TLS cipher suite. TLS automatically negotiates supported ciphers, so this change should be transparent to server operators. However, some TLS middleboxes may be unprepared for the size of a Kyber key encapsulation, or a new TLS ClientHello cipher code point, leading to dropped or hanging connections. This can be resolved by updating your middlebox, or disabling the key encapsulation mechanism via enterprise policy. However, long term, post-quantum secure ciphers will be required in TLS.





- Network Service on Windows will be sandboxedAs early as Chrome 116, to improve security and reliability, the network service, already running in its own process, will be sandboxed on Windows. As part of this, third-party code that is currently able to tamper with the network service may be prevented from doing so. This might cause interoperability issues with software that injects code into Chrome's process space, such as Data Loss Prevention software. TheNetworkServiceSandboxEnabledpolicy allows you to disable the sandbox if incompatibilities are discovered. You can test the sandbox in your environment usingthese instructionsandreportany issues you encounter.





- Restricting the use of --load-extensionThe--load-extensioncommand-line switch provides a very low bar for cookie theft malware to load malicious extensions without an installation prompt. Chrome will gradually phase out this switch to reduce this attack vector for malware. Starting in Chrome 116,--load-extensionwill be ignored for users that have enabled Enhanced Safe Browsing.





- Enable access toWebUSB API from extension service workers in Chrome 116As early as Chrome 116, we will enable access to WebUSB API from extension service workers as a migration path for Manifest V2 extensions that currently access the API from a background page.WebUSB policies can also be applied to extension origins to control this behavior. SeeDefaultWebUsbGuardSetting,WebUsbAskForUrls,WebUsbBlockedForUrls, andWebUsbAllowDevicesForUrlsfor more details.


As early as Chrome 116, we will enable access to WebUSB API from extension service workers as a migration path for Manifest V2 extensions that currently access the API from a background page.





- Removal of the RendererCodeIntegrityEnabled policyAs early as Chrome 117, theRendererCodeIntegrityEnabledpolicy will be removed. You can verify whether your third party software works by no longer applying the policy. You can report any issues you encounter by submitting a bughere.

- Chrome 117 will no longer support macOS 10.13 and macOS 10.14Chrome 117 will no longer support macOS 10.13 and macOS 10.14, which are already outside of their support window with Apple. Users have to update their operating systems in order to continue running Chrome browser. Running on a supported operating system is essential to maintaining security. Starting in Chrome 114, you'll see an infobar that reminds users that Chrome 117 will no longer support macOS 10.13 and macOS 10.14.





- New Chrome Desktop refresh and Chrome menu in Chrome 117With Google’s design platform moving toGoogle Material 3, we have an opportunity to modernize our desktop browser across OS’s, leveraging updated UI elements or styling, enhancing personalization through a new dynamic color system, and improving accessibility. The first wave of UI updates will roll out in Chrome 117.The three dot Chrome menu will also be refreshed, providing a foundation to scale desktop Chrome UI, communications, and personalization. The menu will be updated in phases starting in Chrome 117 with the Desktop Refresh.





- Update for lock iconWe plan to replace the lock icon with a variant of the tune icon, which is commonly used to indicate controls and settings. Replacing the lock icon with a neutral indicator prevents the misunderstanding that the lock icon is associated with the trustworthiness of a page, and emphasizes that security should be the default state in Chrome. Our research has also shown that many users never understood that clicking the lock icon showed important information and controls. We think the new icon helps make permission controls and additional security information more accessible, while avoiding the misunderstandings that plague the lock icon.The new icon is scheduled to launch in Chrome 117, which releases in early September 2023, as part of a general design refresh for desktop platforms. Chrome will continue to alert users when their connection is not secure. You can see the new tune icon now in Chrome Canary if you enable Chrome Refresh 2023 atchrome://flags#chrome-refresh-2023, but keep in mind this flag enables work that is still actively in-progress and under development, and does not represent a final product.You can read more inthisblog post.








- Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3Chrome extensions are transitioning to a new manifest version, Manifest V3. This will bring improved privacy for your users—for example, by moving to a model where extensions modify requests declaratively, without the ability to see individual requests. This also improves extension security, as remotely hosted code will be disallowed on Manifest V3.As mentioned earlier in our blog post,More details on the transition to Manifest V3, the Manifest V2 deprecation timelines are under review and the experiments scheduled for early 2023 are being postponed.During the timeline review, existing Manifest V2 extensions can still be updated, and still run in Chrome. However, all new extensions submitted to the Chrome Web Store must implement Manifest V3.Starting with Chrome 110, an Enterprise policyExtensionManifestV2Availabilityhas been available to control whether Manifest v2 extensions are allowed. The policy can be used to test Manifest V3 in your organization ahead of the migration. After the migration the policy will allow you to extend the usage of Manifest V2 extensions until at least January 2024.You can see which Manifest version is being used by all Chrome extensions running on your fleet using the Apps & extensions usage page inChrome Browser Cloud Management.For more details, refer to theManifest V2 support timeline.





- Chrome 119 to phase out support for Web SQLStarting in Chrome 119, to improve user data security, Chrome will remove support for Web SQL. The Web SQL Database standard was first proposed in April 2009 and abandoned in November 2010. As of today, Chrome is the only major browser with support for Web SQL. The W3C encouraged those needing web databases to adopt Indexed Database or SQLite WASM.The timeline for the deprecation will be:Chrome 115 - Add deprecation messageChrome 118 - 123  - Deprecation trialChrome 119 - Ship removalMore details about the deprecation and removal can be found on theChromestatuspage.An enterprise policyWebSQLAccessis available until Chrome 123 to enable Web SQL to be available.
- Chrome 115 - Add deprecation message
- Chrome 118 - 123  - Deprecation trial
- Chrome 119 - Ship removal


- Chrome 115 - Add deprecation message
- Chrome 118 - 123  - Deprecation trial
- Chrome 119 - Ship removal



#### Upcoming browser changes

#### Upcoming ChromeOS changes





- App Streaming on ChromeOSAs early as ChromeOS 115, App Streaming will enhance thePhone Hubexperience, by allowing users to see and interact with streamed apps running on their Pixel phone. When a user receives a mirrored conversation notification from their Pixel phone, a simple tap on that notification will kick off an app stream directly to the user's ChromeOS desktop. This is part of aGoogle-wide ambient computingeffort.





- Google Photos Shared AlbumsIn ChromeOS 104, we let users useGoogle Photos for Wallpapers and Screensavers, but we restricted access to Shared Albums due to privacy concerns. In Chrome 115, we will address these privacy concerns to allow users to select photos from Shared Albums.





- Removal of permissive Chrome Apps webview behaviorsAs early as Chrome 116, Chrome Appswebviewusage have the following restrictions:SSL errors within webview show an error page that does not provide the user the option to unsafely proceed.The use of the webviewNewWindowevent to attach to a webview element in another App window causes the window reference returned by thewindow.opencall in the originating webview to be invalidated.A temporary enterprise policyChromeAppsWebViewPermissiveBehaviorAllowedwill be available to give enterprises time to address possible breakage related to these changes. To test whether this change is the cause of any breakage, without needing to set the enterprise policy, the previous behavior from Chrome 112 and earlier can also be restored by navigating to chrome://flags and disablingchrome://flags/#enable-webview-tag-mparch-behavior.This change was originally scheduled for Chrome 113, but was postponed.
- SSL errors within webview show an error page that does not provide the user the option to unsafely proceed.
- The use of the webviewNewWindowevent to attach to a webview element in another App window causes the window reference returned by thewindow.opencall in the originating webview to be invalidated.

#### Upcoming Admin console changes

## Chrome browser updates





- First-Party Sets user controlsFirst-Party Setsis an upcoming framework for developers to declare relationships between domains, such that the browser can make decisions regarding access based on the third party’s relationship to the first party. A set may enjoy first party benefits, including continued access to their cookies when the top-level domain is in the same set.First-Party Sets are part of Chrome's roadmap for a more privacy-focused web.Chrome 113 introduces user controls for these First-Party Sets. Two enterprise policies are available to manage First-Party Sets:FirstPartySetsEnabledto enable or disable First-Party Sets, andFirstPartySetsOverridesto apply your own sets.





- Collect additional data for off-store extensions in telemetry reportsWhen Enhanced Safe Browsing is enabled, Chrome 113 starts collecting additional telemetry on off-store extensions, such as file hashes and themanifest.jsonfile. Google servers analyze the data collected to detect malicious off-store extensions (including self-hosted extensions) and improve protection for all Chrome extension users. This functionality along with the entire extension telemetry feature can be turned off by settingSafeBrowsingProtectionLevelto any value other than 2; this disables Enhanced Safe Browsing. Enterprise admins can use theSafeBrowsingProtectionLevelpolicy if they have any concerns about exposing this data.





- Launching FastCheckout for Checkout experiencesIn Chrome 113, some users see updated Autofill options targeting checkout pages on some shopping websites. It can be disabled by either disabling policyAutofillAddressEnabledorAutofillCreditCardEnabled.

- Updated Password Management Experience on iOS in Chrome 113On Chrome on iOS, some users who are signed-in to Chrome but don't have Chrome sync enabled can now use and save passwords in their Google Account. Relevant enterprise policies such asBrowserSignin,SyncDisabled,SyncTypesListDisabledandPasswordManagerEnabledcontinue to work as before and can be used to configure whether users can use and save passwords in their Google Account.





- Image-set css changesChrome 113 implements standard syntax support for image-set and now treats the previously supported-webkit- vendorprefix syntax as a parse time alias for the standard. This means that values set with the vendor prefix serialize as standard.Example:-webkit-image-set(url(example.png) 1x)Serializes to:image-set(url(""example.png"") 1x) for specified value (as returned via getPropertyValue() like: testDiv.style.getPropertyValue(""background-image"");)and toimage-set(url(""example.png"") 1dppx) for computed value (as returned via getComputedStyle() like window.getComputedStyle(testDiv)[""background-image""]).If needed, the new behavior can be turned off via theCSSImageSetruntime flag. The rendering and image-selection behavior is the same for both the prefixed and standard syntax (Chrome Status).





- Restructure of the three-dot menu in DesktopWe want to help our users to discover how to customize Chrome to perfectly fit their needs by moving Extensions and the Chrome Web Store to the first level of the three-dot menu.





- Policy troubleshooting page available on Androidchrome://policy/logsis a new page that admins can use to help troubleshoot enterprise policies on Android. On iOS, this becomes available in Chrome 113.





- Chrome DesktopNew tabpage: Journeys cardChrome assists with complex, multi-session task completion through Journeys resumption and next step suggestions on theNew tabpage. You can control the visibility of cards on theNew tabpage using theNTPCardsVisiblepolicy.

- Discover Feed on iOS and AndroidIn Chrome 113, Chrome might prompt some users to see more personalized content in their Discover Feed.The Discover Feed also allows non-signed-in users to control the types of content they see, using updated personalization options. For example, they may choose to hide content from a certain source.When users who are not signed in want to make a change to their feed content, Chrome prompts them to sign in or sync. As an admin, you still control user sign-in and sync with theBrowserSignin,SyncDisabled, andSyncTypesListDisabledpolicies. So, if an enterprise policy prevents sign-in or sync, users seeNot available on your device.





- Adopt Android media pickerChrome browser replaces its custom media picker for the new unified Android media picker, when uploading photos and videos to the web. The two are functionally equivalent, but there are slight differences in how they look.

- Screensaver previewIn ChromeOS 113, a new option allows users to preview screensaver settings before applying. A preview is useful especially when using Google Photos with animations.





- Report USB firmware versionWhenever a USB device is plugged or unplugged from a managed ChromeOS device, the USB firmware version is reported alongside existing USB events and telemetry. You can control this using theReportDevicePeripheralspolicy, which controls reporting of existing USB events and telemetry.





- Allow policy-provided custom trust anchors at the lock screenEnterprise and EDU deployments might have proxies that intercept, decrypt and inspect user traffic. This requires the client device to have a CA certificate configured to allow it to trust the proxy server certificate for all web hosts, which is usually issued on the fly. For ChromeOS, enterprise deployments configure such trusted CA certificates through enterprise policy.These custom policy-provided CA certificates are currently only honored for user traffic and inside the user session, but not at the lock screen. This is an issue for customers who have to do re-authentication at the lock screen, which is enforced by policy,  since the proxy set in the user session is enforced at the lock screen but the CA certificate is not accessible.





- Files app inline sync statusThis feature moves the existing syncing notification and visual signal to a more granular inline sync status. The status appears adjacent to files in Google Drive that are actively syncing. The status also displays for folders within a hierarchy that have syncing descendants.





- ChromeOS administrator instant rebootWith ChromeOS 113, we give admins the option to trigger ChromeOS reboots via the Admin console to facilitate support flows and apply policies instantly when required. With this option, admins can now instantly apply settings across their fleet, or on a subset of devices. For example, in a cyber attack scenario, admins can now mitigate a current attack by limiting extension permissions and forcing an instant reboot to all affected devices.A message displays to notify users of the reboot, so they can save any work or manage their time before the reboot occurs.

#### Upcoming browser changes





- Chrome Root Store updates and removal of the ChromeRootStoreEnabled policyAs early as Chrome 114, to improve user security and provide a consistent experience across different platforms, Chrome will switch to its own default root store and built-in certificate verifier on Android, Linux, and ChromeOS. Chrome continues to use custom local roots installed to the operating system’s trust store. See our article about the Chrome Root Program for more information. The Chrome Root Store is already default enabled on Windows and Mac.We do not anticipate any changes to how enterprises currently manage their fleet and trusted enterprise CAs, such as through group policy, macOS Keychain Access, or system management tools like Puppet.TheChromeRootStoreEnabledpolicy allows selective disabling of the Chrome Root Store in favor of the platform root store. You can set this policy to Disabled to force the use of the platform root store, otherwise it is enabled by default. The policy will be made available onAndroid, Linux, and ChromeOSuntil Chrome 120.TheChromeRootStoreEnabledpolicy has been removed fromWindows and Macin Chrome 113. Support for trusted leaf certificates and the Windows Trusted People store was added for Chrome 111. Support for name constraints on local trust anchors was added back in Chrome 112.





- Support for Private State TokensStarting in Chrome 113, the Private State Tokens API will be available for use by websites. Private State Tokens enable trust in a user's authenticity to be conveyed from one context to another, to help sites combat fraud and distinguish bots from real humans—without the exchange of user identifying information. Availability of Private State Tokens will be controlled using a new setting in Chrome settings calledAuto-verify. For more information, see thisdeveloper blog post.

- New inactive tabs section in the Chrome app on iPhone and iPadIn Chrome 114, old tabs will be hidden under a new Inactive Tabs section in the Tab grid view. Chrome users will be able to access the inactive tabs section to view all old tabs or close them using the new bulk tab functionality. Alternatively, users can bring back an inactive tab by clicking on it.





- Lock profile cookie files on diskTo help protect Chrome users against malware attempting to steal cookie information, Chrome 114 on Windows holds an exclusive lock on the profile cookie files on disk. You can test this behavior to ensure this doesn't interfere with any sanctioned software on your systems by running Chrome with the-enable-features=LockProfileCookieDatabasecommand line flag on Dev and Beta channel of Chrome 114.





- Changes to Google Password Manager in Chrome 114In Chrome 114, the password manager will be rebranded asGoogle Password Manager.Google Password Managerwill offer more functionality and be easier to access. You will be able to access the new look password manager via the three dot menu (previously located inSettings>Autofill). The upgradedGoogle Password Managergroups similar passwords together, has an improved checkup flow and users will be able to add the password manager to their desktop, for easy access.





- Updates to Bookmarks on DesktopIn Chrome 114, some users will see an updated experience of the Bookmarks side panel content and entry point to be inclusive of bookmark powers, as well as other features such as filtering, sorting, and editing.

- Password management: save and retrieve notesChrome 114 will revamp the password management native bubble triggered from the key icon in the omnibox. It will replace the current list of passwords with a new list that allows navigating to the password details view. In thepassword detailsview, shown on the right below, users can copy the username or password, unmask the password, and edit the stored note.





- Unpacking Nested Archives in Download ProtectionStarting in Chrome 114, users with Safe Browsing enabled will begin recursively unpacking downloads of archives. This extends the long-standing protections Chrome offers against malware and unwanted software to combat techniques being abused by distributors of cookie theft malware. TheSafeBrowsingProtectionLevelpolicy can be used to enable or disable Safe Browsing, including this feature.





- Separate storage of settings synced to account in Chrome 114For Chrome users on iOS and Android who have Sync enabled, settings synced to their Google account will be be kept separate from the local Chrome settings, which were set when Sync was turned-off. This will allow for strictly less data sharing than previously: local settings don’t get automatically uploaded when turning on Sync, and no settings from the account are left behind on the device when Sync is turned off. This feature is still disabled by default and can be enabled viachrome://flags#enable-preferences-account-storage.There are two existing policies to disable Sync functionality, which will continue to apply:SyncDisabled: Disables the entire Chrome Sync infrastructure, including settings.SyncTypesListDisabled: Disables specified individual Sync data types. The existing valuepreferencescovers settings.
- SyncDisabled: Disables the entire Chrome Sync infrastructure, including settings.
- SyncTypesListDisabled: Disables specified individual Sync data types. The existing valuepreferencescovers settings.


1. SyncDisabled: Disables the entire Chrome Sync infrastructure, including settings.
2. SyncTypesListDisabled: Disables specified individual Sync data types. The existing valuepreferencescovers settings.





- Chrome policy: disable extensions unpublished from Chrome Web Store (CWS)As early as Chrome 115, we will release an Enterprise policy to disable extensions that have been unpublished from the Chrome Web Store.





- Network Service on Windows will be sandboxedAs early as Chrome 115, to improve security and reliability, the network service, already running in its own process, will be sandboxed on Windows. As part of this, third-party code that is currently able to tamper with the network service may be prevented from doing so. This might cause interoperability issues with software that injects code into Chrome's process space, such as Data Loss Prevention software. TheNetworkServiceSandboxEnabledpolicy allows you to disable the sandbox if incompatibilities are discovered. You can test the sandbox in your environment usingthese instructionsandreportany issues you encounter.

- Enable access toWebUSB API from extension service workers in Chrome 115As early as Chrome 115, we will enable access to WebUSB API from extension service workers as a migration path for Manifest V2 extensions that currently access the API from a background page.WebUSB policies can also be applied to extension origins to control this behavior. SeeDefaultWebUsbGuardSetting,WebUsbAskForUrls,WebUsbBlockedForUrls, andWebUsbAllowDevicesForUrlsfor more details.


As early as Chrome 115, we will enable access to WebUSB API from extension service workers as a migration path for Manifest V2 extensions that currently access the API from a background page.





- Skip unload eventsThe presence of unload event listeners is a primary blocker forback/forward cacheon Chromium based browsers and for Firefox on desktop platforms. On the other hand, for mobile platforms, almost all browsers prioritize thebfcacheby not firing unload events in most cases. To improve the situation, we’ve been working with lots of partners and successfully reduced the use of unload event listeners over the last few years. To further accelerate this migration, weproposeto have Chrome for desktop gradually skip unload events, as early as Chrome 115. In case you need more time to migrate away from unload events, we’ll offer temporary opt-outs in the form of an API and a group policy which will allow you to selectively keep the behavior unchanged.





- Release cycle changesChrome 115 stable release will be moved from June 27 to July 18. All dates after this have been adjusted to account for this delay. Please see theChromium Dash Schedulefor updated dates.





- Read modeAs more content is read online, we’re adding a new feature to help boost the reading experience. Introducing reading mode, a new feature on Chrome browser, enhances the reading experience on the web for everyone. Reading mode reduces distracting elements through a resizable and customizable reader view in the Chrome browser side panel, enabling readers to focus on the primary content. Users can also customize the font, text size, spacing, theme/background color, and more, making for a more cohesive, intuitive, and comfortable reading experience.





- HTTP requests upgraded to HTTPS in Chrome 115As early as Chrome 115, some users may see HTTP requests automatically upgraded to HTTPs. Any page that can't load via HTTPS is automatically reverted back to HTTP. For standard server configurations, this shouldn't have any visible effect, but improves your users' security.Some server configurations may cause issues, for example if different content is served via HTTP and HTTPS. Users can disable automatic upgrading for a specific site by changing "Insecure Content" site setting to enabled, accessible via Page Info orchrome://settings/content. You can control this behavior with theHttpsUpgradesEnabledpolicy, and allowlist specific sites with theHttpAllowlistpolicy.In the long term, you should ensure that your organization's servers support HTTPS and serve the same content on both HTTP and HTTPS. If you don't intend to support HTTPS (e.g. on an internal intranet behind a firewall), servers shouldn't respond to port 443, and firewalls should close the connection rather than leave it hanging.





- Deprecation Trial for unpartitioned third-party Storage, Service Workers, and Communication APIsBeginning gradually in Chrome 115, storage, service workers, and communication APIs will bepartitioned in third-party contexts. In addition to being isolated by the same-origin policy, the affected APIs used in third-party contexts will also be separated by the site of the top-level context. Sites that haven’t had time to implement support for third-party storage partitioning can take part in a deprecation trial. During the trial, sites can temporarilyunpartition(continue isolation by same-origin policy but remove isolation by top-level site) and restore prior behavior of storage, service workers, and communication APIs in content embedded on their site.The following APIs remain unpartitioned in third-party contexts should you enroll the top-level site in theDisableThirdPartyStoragePartitioningdeprecation trial:Storage APIs(such as localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB, Quota, and so on),Communication APIs(such as BroadcastChannel, SharedWorkers, and WebLocks), andServiceWorker API.Chrome 113 also adds theDefaultThirdPartyStoragePartitioningSettingenterprise policy, which unpartitions APIs in all third-party contexts, as well asThirdPartyStoragePartitioningBlockedForOrigins, which unpartitions APIs for third-party contexts when the first-party context’s origin matches the list. Both will be supported for at least 12 milestones. You can read more in thisblog post.





- Changes to phishing protection on Android as early as Chrome 115When a user authenticates to Android with their Google password, for example, during account setup, Chrome will be notified so the password can begin receiving phishing protection when surfing the Web with Chrome. In previous versions of Chrome on Android, users needed to explicitly provide their password within a Chrome tab, for example, sign in to Gmail, to receive phishing protection for their Google password.You can disable warnings regarding password reuse by settingPasswordProtectionWarningTriggerto 0.

- Chrome 117 will no longer support macOS 10.13 and macOS 10.14Chrome 117 will no longer support macOS 10.13 and macOS 10.14, which are already outside of their support window with Apple. Users have to update their operating systems in order to continue running Chrome browser. Running on a supported operating system is essential to maintaining security.





- Extensions must be updated to leverage Manifest V3Chrome 112 enables access to the WebHID API from extension service workers, as a migration path for Manifest V2 extensions that currently access the API from a background page.Chrome extensions are transitioning to a new manifest version, Manifest V3. This will bring improved privacy for your users—for example, by moving to a model where extensions modify requests declaratively, without the ability to see individual requests. This also improves extension security, as remotely hosted code will be disallowed on Manifest V3.As mentioned earlier in our blog post,More details on the transition to Manifest V3, the Manifest V2 deprecation timelines are under review and the experiments scheduled for early 2023 are being postponed.During the timeline review, existing Manifest V2 extensions can still be updated, and still run in Chrome. However, all new extensions submitted to the Chrome Web Store must implement Manifest V3.Starting with Chrome 110, an Enterprise policyExtensionManifestV2Availabilityhas been available to control whether Manifest v2 extensions are allowed. The policy can be used to test Manifest V3 in your organization ahead of the migration. After the migration the policy will allow you to extend the usage of Manifest V2 extensions until at least January 2024.You can see which Manifest version is being used by all Chrome extensions running on your fleet using the Apps & extensions usage page inChrome Browser Cloud Management.For more details, refer to theManifest V2 support timeline.

#### Upcoming ChromeOS changes





- Cursive pre-installed for Enterprise and Education accountsAs early as ChromeOS 114,Cursive, a stylus-first notes app, will be available for Chromebook. It will be pre-installed for all Enterprise and Education accounts on stylus-enabled Chromebooks. If you want toblock access to the app, you can prevent Chromebooks in your enterprise from accessingcursive.apps.chrome.





- Passpoint: Seamless, secure connection to Wi-Fi networksStarting as early as ChromeOS 114, Passpoint will streamline Wi-Fi access and eliminate the need for users to find and authenticate a network each time they visit.  Once a user accesses the Wi-Fi network offered at a location, the Passpoint-enabled client device will automatically connect upon subsequent visits.





- Mandatory extensions for Incognito navigationIn Chrome OS 114, Extensions allow admins to enforce security features and customizations in their OU but they cannot be enforced in Incognito mode without user consent. This can be a problem as users can bypass extension-set features, for example, proxies by using Incognito mode for navigation.TheMandatoryExtensionsForIncognitoNavigationpolicy will allow administrators to configure a list of extensions, which users need to explicitly allow to run in Incognito, to use Incognito mode for navigation.





- App Streaming on Chrome OSIn Chrome OS 114, App Streaming will enhance thePhone Hubexperience, by allowing users to see and interact with streamed apps running on their Pixel phone. When a user receives a mirrored conversation notification from their Pixel phone, a simple tap on that notification will kick off an app stream directly to the user's Chrome OS desktop. This is part of aGoogle-wide ambient computingeffort.
