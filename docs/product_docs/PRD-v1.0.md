# PRD: Upstream Digest Server v1.0

## Background & Context
This product is developed for internal use by a Chromium-based browser development team. The primary users are product managers and engineers who need to stay informed about Chrome updates to guide their own browser development efforts. As an internal tool for a technical team, the focus is on accurate information delivery and efficient monitoring of both stable and pre-release Chrome versions.

## Problem Statement
The current v0.5 upstream digest server produces functional but basic HTML outputs with limited visual appeal and no internationalization support. Our browser development team needs professional presentation with bilingual support (English default, Chinese optional) for tracking Chrome updates across all release channels. The system requires production-ready error handling, accurate technical terminology preservation, and comprehensive coverage of pre-release versions (beta, dev, canary) that are critical for browser development planning.

## Success Metrics
- Primary: 100% successful generation of both Chinese and English versions for all digest types
- Secondary: HTML output passes accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Secondary: Language toggle responds within 200ms across all supported browsers
- Quality: Zero visual layout issues across desktop and mobile viewports

## User Stories

### Browser Development Engineer  
As a browser development engineer on our Chromium-based browser team, I want to access Chrome API updates and platform changes across all release channels (stable, beta, dev, canary) with clear visual organization so that I can plan our browser's feature development and compatibility updates.

### Product Manager (Browser Team)
As a product manager for our browser product, I want to receive Chrome digest updates in English (with optional Chinese translation) covering both stable and pre-release versions so that I can make informed product decisions and communicate changes to stakeholders.

### Technical Documentation Manager
As a technical documentation manager, I want digest content presented in professional card layouts so that I can easily extract and repurpose information for internal documentation and training materials.
