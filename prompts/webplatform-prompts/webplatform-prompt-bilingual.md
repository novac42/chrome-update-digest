# Placeholder for bilingual prompt

This file exists to satisfy MCP server resource registration.

The actual bilingual functionality is implemented by calling both:
- `webplatform-prompt-en.md` for English output
- `webplatform-prompt-zh.md` for Chinese output

These are called separately to generate two independent digest files.
